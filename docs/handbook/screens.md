# Screens

Every variant below is captured in all four Linux Chromium combos (desktop/mobile × light/dark). Markdown images are the desktop-light shot. The other combo PNGs are visual-test baselines only.

**Role hierarchy.** Ranks are basis 0, verified 1, moderator 2, initiator 2, founder 3. Initiator is rank 2, equal to moderator. A named minimum means that rank or any higher rank, and an equal rank meets it. The app checks this with `roleAtLeast` (`src/lib/roles.ts`); an equality test on the viewer's role is a defect. Do not write "moderator or initiator" or „Moderator oder Initiator“; permission checks name the minimum rank only.

## Screen: /

- **URL:** `/` — public marketing landing (no auth gate).
- **What the user sees:** Dark 21.gifts header with one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark and a language switcher (wordmark the localized public home when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow). The language-prefixed public URL (`/en`, `/de`, `/es`, or `/fil`) has reciprocal language links and a matching canonical. The Bitcoin-led hero offers **Ask for help** (`/login`) first and **Send help** (`/{locale}/donate`) second, with a labeled, non-interactive example of the real post → reply → Bitcoin journey and a wallet → Bitcoin → recipient diagram using the familiar orange Bitcoin symbol. Light sections show three donor steps and three discovery links. Why uses four concise cards. Happyland follows with four photographs from the original 21.gifts page, an unlinked source paragraph, and three concrete observations in all four languages. The dark closing sections distinguish gifts to people from separate support for the 21.gifts project at `21gifts@walletofsatoshi.com`, then answer common questions. **Install app** appears in the header and after Send help only for iPhone Safari/Chrome/Firefox/Edge (not standalone, not in-app) or when Chromium fires `beforeinstallprompt`; idle visual snapshots stay without it because the control renders `null` until after mount detection.
- **Actions:** Read the pitch, change language, open login, open Send help, optionally install the app (Chromium prompt or iPhone three-step Share sheet), jump to in-page sections, open About, open Stats, open Legal & Privacy, open the Handbook.
- **Calls:** `Home` (`src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx`) inside `MarketingLayout`, `LanguageSwitcher`, `PwaInstall`, `HappylandSection`, `ProfileChromeLeft`.

### Variant: default

Desktop/wide layout (from 1024px): section nav is visible in the header (How it works, Happyland, Why, FAQ, About 21.gifts, Stats, Handbook, Log in). Happyland links to `/{locale}#happyland`, including from other marketing pages, and leaves space below the sticky header for the section heading. No hamburger.

![21.gifts home](images/root.png)

### Variant: mobile-nav

Captured at desktop and mobile. Below 1024px the header shows the Menu button; open it to reveal the same links stacked, with Happyland immediately after How it works. Tapping Happyland closes the menu and scrolls to the existing place portrait. On desktop this is the landing without the hamburger.

![21.gifts home mobile nav](images/root-mobile-nav.png)

### Variant: language-open

Open the language switcher in the marketing header. Custom listbox (rounded panel, endonym rows with a check on the current locale) — not OS chrome.

![21.gifts home language](images/root-language.png)

## Screen: /legal

- **URL:** `/legal` — imprint and privacy. `/legal.html` permanently redirects here.
- **What the user sees:** Dark 21.gifts header with one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (wordmark the localized public home when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow) and a language switcher, Legal Notice (Switzerland) and Privacy Policy (no analytics; `locale` only after a language choice, when you open a language address such as `/de`, or to mirror the account language; `fiat` only as CHF/EUR/USD/PHP after a currency choice or to mirror the account currency; choosing `numberFormat` writes its cookie and absent means Swiss `10'000.23`; choosing light/dark writes `theme` and System removes it; a logged-in session token is stored in `localStorage`; Cloudflare TLS; login on this origin). There is **no published email**; contact is in-app only via `/contact` after login. Legal body copy stays English.
- **Actions:** Change language. Signed-out choices remain cookie-only and do not write an account. Read the legal body. Open **Open the app** (`/contact`). Header **Log in** goes to `/login`.
- **Calls:** `LegalPage` inside `MarketingLayout`, `LanguageSwitcher`.

### Variant: default

The only state: imprint plus privacy, marketing chrome.

![21.gifts legal](images/legal.png)

## Screen: /about

- **Purpose:** Public foundation of the house — three convictions and Matthew 10:8.
- **URL:** `/about` — public marketing page (no auth gate).
- **What the user sees:** Dark 21.gifts header with one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark and a language switcher (wordmark the localized public home when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow), kicker **The idea**, heading **What 21.gifts stands for**, a short lead, the Matthew 10:8 verse, then three numbered convictions (Giving is part of faith with 1 John 3:18; Directly from person to person; Why Bitcoin?) and **Go to the forum** (`/welcome`). Visitor copy comes from the catalog.
- **Actions:** Change language. Read the convictions. Open **Go to the forum** (`/welcome`). Header **Log in** goes to `/login`.
- **Calls:** `AboutPage` inside `MarketingLayout`, `LanguageSwitcher`, `ButtonLink`.

### Variant: default

The only state: three convictions, verse, and forum CTA, marketing chrome.

![21.gifts about](images/about.png)

## Screen: /stats/[day]

- **URL:** `/stats/YYYY-MM-DD` — public list of outbound gifts that UTC day. Invalid dates 404.
- **What the user sees:** Dark 21.gifts header with one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (wordmark the localized public home when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow), an **All stats** link to `/stats` (not a second back control), heading **Donations on {day}**, a **UTC day** date input, then either the donation table (Time, Recipient, ₿, selected fiat code) with a FiatPicker **only when unsigned**, empty copy **No donations recorded on this day.**, **Loading…**, or **Try again**. Signed-in visitors still see preferred-fiat amounts and cannot change the code here. Summary `{n} donation(s) · ₿ · formatFiatDisplay(total, preferred fiat, numberFormat)`. Stats body copy stays English.
- **Actions:** Pick another UTC day in the date input (navigates to `/stats/{next}`). When unsigned, pick CHF | EUR | USD | PHP on FiatPicker (writes cookie `fiat`). Open **All stats**. Change language. Number format is a signed-in `/profile` settings row next to theme, not Menu chrome, and not on this public header. Header **Log in** goes to `/login`.
- **Calls:** `GiftDayPage`, `DayLoader`, `GiftDayTable`, `FiatPicker`, `fetchGiftDay` (`GET /gifts?day=`).
- **Auth:** None.

### Variant: default

Loaded day with at least one donation row (recipient **alice**).

![21.gifts gifts on a day](images/stats-day.png)

### Variant: empty

No donations that UTC day. Copy **No donations recorded on this day.**

![21.gifts empty day](images/stats-day-empty.png)

### Variant: loading

Waiting on `GET /gifts`. Copy **Loading…**

![21.gifts day loading](images/stats-day-loading.png)

### Variant: error

Fetch failed. Button **Try again**.

![21.gifts day error](images/stats-day-error.png)

## Screen: /stats

- **URL:** `/stats` — public gift totals and a posts total (no auth gate).
- **What the user sees:** Dark 21.gifts header with one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (wordmark the localized public home when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow) and a language switcher, heading **Donations**. When post stats load, a **Posts** total sits above the donation cards: living notes and replies counted together, hidden notes excluded, with a bar on each UTC day that has posts and a gap where a day has none. A failed post fetch omits that block and still shows the donation diagrams. Four KPI cards (total spent as BIP-177 **₿** plus the selected fiat, donations, people, period), a FiatPicker (CHF | EUR | USD | PHP) above the cards **only when unsigned**, then diagrams: **Total spend over time** (one cumulative chart; days with spend are markers on the series, not a wrapping date list), **By person** and **By month**. Each diagram has a `SegmentedControl tone="gift" shell="dark"` ₿ | selected fiat control that defaults to ₿; over time switches the series, person and month rescale bar size while labels stay both units. Signed-in visitors still display and scale with the preferred code and cannot change it here. Empty database copy: **No donations recorded yet.** Stats body copy stays English.
- **Actions:** Change language. Read the posts total and the gift charts. Open a spend day (`/stats/{YYYY-MM-DD}`) from **Total spend over time** by clicking a day with spend. When unsigned, pick CHF | EUR | USD | PHP on FiatPicker (writes cookie `fiat`). Switch **Total spend over time** / **By person** / **By month** between ₿ and the selected fiat. Header **Stats** stays on this page; **Log in** goes to `/login`.
- **Calls:** `StatsPage`, `StatsLoader`, `StatsDashboard`, `FiatPicker`, `fetchGiftStats` (same-origin `GET /gifts/stats`), `fetchPostStats` (same-origin `GET /messages/stats`), `LanguageSwitcher`.

### Variant: default

Loaded stats. **Posts** shows notes and replies as one total, with a bar on days that have posts and a gap on days that have none. One cumulative over-time chart is visible. Scale defaults to ₿.

![21.gifts stats](images/stats.png)

### Variant: usd-scale

Inverted ranking fixture (June tall in ₿ / short in USD, July the reverse). **Posts** stays the same notes-and-replies total. Scale switched to USD on **Total spend over time**, **By person**, and **By month**.

![21.gifts stats USD scale](images/stats-usd-scale.png)

### Variant: empty

Zero donations and zero posts. **Posts** shows 0 with no bars. KPI zeros and **No donations recorded yet.**

![21.gifts stats empty](images/stats-empty.png)

### Variant: loading

Waiting on `GET /gifts/stats`. Copy **Loading…**

![21.gifts stats loading](images/stats-loading.png)

### Variant: error

Fetch failed. Copy **Could not load donation stats. Please try again.** and **Try again**.

![21.gifts stats error](images/stats-error.png)

## Screen: /trust-chain

- **URL:** `/trust-chain` — signed-in Trust Chain. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome` (`OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`). JSON is `/trust/graph` (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page). Any logged-in completed account may view (not staff-only).
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` (the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; wordmark → `/welcome`), and Menu, inside the rounded sheet). Fill `AppShell` (`align="start"`). Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**. Heading **Trust Chain**, a short lead that says to click a person to load everyone linked to them and drag a person to move them, then a chain that starts with the founder. Clicking a person loads one hop of stored links (never the whole thousand-person graph at once). One next person sits to the right; several people hanging off one person (everyone a moderator verified) stack top to bottom. Dragging a person moves that block; already-placed people keep their spot when a hop arrives. Below the diagram, four short explanations: **Verified**, **Moderator**, **Initiator**, and **Founder** (an initiator is named directly, with no proposal step; catalog `trustChain.explainInitiator`). Empty copy: **No one is on the Trust Chain yet.** Loading copy: **Loading…**. Error copy plus **Try again**.
- **Actions:** Click a person to load who they met or appointed. Drag a person to rearrange. Modifier-click a person to open the member card (`/members/{id}`). The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `TrustChainPage`, `TrustChainLoader`, `TrustChainScreen`, `TrustChainDiagram`, `layoutTrustChain`, `mergeTrustChain`, `fetchTrustChain` (same-origin `GET /trust/graph` and `GET /trust/graph?around=`), `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`.
- **Auth:** Bearer session; `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`.

### Variant: default

Founder seed **Cyrill** only. Lead tells the visitor to click a person to load everyone linked to them.

![21.gifts Trust Chain](images/trust-chain.png)

### Variant: expanded

Click **Cyrill**, then **Severin**. The chain grows left to right: Cyrill appointed Severin, who verified Ada and Bob.

![21.gifts Trust Chain expanded](images/trust-chain-expanded.png)

### Variant: empty

Zero nodes. Copy **No one is on the Trust Chain yet.**

![21.gifts Trust Chain empty](images/trust-chain-empty.png)

### Variant: loading

Waiting on `GET /trust/graph`. Copy **Loading…**

![21.gifts Trust Chain loading](images/trust-chain-loading.png)

### Variant: error

Fetch failed. Copy **Could not load the Trust Chain. Please try again.** and **Try again**.

![21.gifts Trust Chain error](images/trust-chain-error.png)

### Variant: hop-error

Founder seed is on screen. Clicking that person fails the hop fetch. The diagram stays; the same error copy and **Try again** sit above it. Retry re-fetches that hop without re-fetching founder seeds; the banner stays gone only if the hop succeeds.

![21.gifts Trust Chain hop error](images/trust-chain-hop-error.png)

## Screen: /wallet

- **URL:** `/wallet` — signed-in receive address. The recovery phrase is a separate page.
- **What the user sees:** Fill `AppShell` with profile chrome left and **Menu** right. Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**. Heading **Wallet** is first, then the centered 21.gifts address, Open CryptoPay QR, and a content-width **Set an amount** link to `/pos`. Below that card, the phrase is not a setup step and is not shown at sign-in. Missing or empty `passkeyCredentialId`: content-width **Add recovery phrase** linking to `/wallet/phrase`, plus a hint that the phrase is created on this device and the existing login passkey stays. Set id: **Show recovery phrase** under **Advanced functions**, linking to `/wallet/phrase`. This page never shows the 12 words, a recovery error, a keypad, or an open charge.
- **Actions:** **Set an amount** opens `/pos`. **Add recovery phrase** opens `/wallet/phrase`. **Show recovery phrase** opens `/wallet/phrase` and is only inside **Advanced functions**. Open **Menu** (Home, Shops, Point of sale, Profile, Grants, Wallet, …). Back closes **Advanced functions** when that row is open, then the top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `WalletScreenView` (registers `ProfileChromeLeft` through `AppShellTopLeft`; that Back is the one on screen, not the page `WalletChromeLeft`), `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `WalletScreen`, `useWalletPhrase`.

### Variant: default

Existing member, no phrase yet. Receive address and QR above **Add recovery phrase**.

![21.gifts wallet add recovery phrase](images/wallet.png)

### Variant: reveal

Account that can already show a phrase. Receive address above closed **Advanced functions**.

![21.gifts wallet reveal](images/wallet-reveal.png)

### Variant: reveal-open

Account that can already show a phrase. Open **Advanced functions** shows **Show recovery phrase**, which links to `/wallet/phrase`.

![21.gifts wallet reveal open](images/wallet-reveal-open.png)

## Screen: /wallet/phrase

- **URL:** `/wallet/phrase` — recovery phrase only. No receive QR.
- **What the user sees:** Same signed-in chrome as `/wallet`. Heading **Wallet**. No address, no QR, and no **Set an amount**. Missing or empty `passkeyCredentialId`: the hint and **Add recovery phrase**, which runs the ceremony on this page. Set id and no words yet: **Show recovery phrase** runs PRF get of that id, without `credentials.create` and without seed/begin. The 12 words and the only-backup line replace that button. There is no confirmation and no **Continue**. An error is `role="alert"` plus a reason, a hint, and **Try again**.
- **Actions:** **Add recovery phrase** calls seed/begin and seed/finish and does not replace the login passkey. `walletBackupSeenAt` is not read and not posted. **Show recovery phrase** is the only way to see an existing phrase, and only after **Advanced functions** on `/wallet`. **Try again** clears the error. Back hides the 12 words, then the top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `WalletScreenView` `surface="phrase"`, `WalletPhraseScreen`, `WalletPhrasePage`, `useWalletPhrase`, `OnboardingGate`.

### Variant: default

No phrase yet. **Add recovery phrase** on its own page. No receive QR.

![21.gifts wallet phrase add](images/wallet-phrase-add.png)

### Variant: reveal

The passkey can already show a phrase. **Show recovery phrase** is the only control. No receive QR.

![21.gifts wallet phrase reveal](images/wallet-phrase-reveal.png)

### Variant: phrase

12-word grid from a fixture mnemonic (not live PRF). No receive QR.

![21.gifts wallet phrase](images/wallet-phrase.png)

### Variant: error

Generic failure. Alert **The recovery phrase could not be created or opened. Check this device and try again.** plus hint **If this keeps happening, try another browser or the device you already used to sign in.** and labeled **Try again**. No receive QR.

![21.gifts wallet error](images/wallet-error.png)

### Variant: timeout

Device prompt timed out. Alert **The device prompt timed out before you finished. Try again.** plus the same muted hint and labeled **Try again**. No receive QR.

![21.gifts wallet timeout](images/wallet-timeout.png)

### Variant: prf-unsupported

PRF missing. Alert **This browser cannot create a recovery phrase. Try another browser or device.** plus hint **If this keeps happening, try another browser or the device you already used to sign in.** and labeled **Try again**. No receive QR.

![21.gifts wallet prf unsupported](images/wallet-prf-unsupported.png)

## Screen: /login

- **URL:** `/login` — login only.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` with `HomeWordmark` and the light language switcher inside the rounded sheet; the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; wordmark `/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated — not the marketing header). Idle **Log in**. After **Log in**, if the browser reports `NotAllowedError`, heading **Do you already have an account?** with **Log in with existing account** and **Open a new account**. **Open a new account** opens the name form. No passkey and no account until a valid name is submitted and the create ceremony is finished. In Telegram or another in-app browser, an escape card (**Open this page in your browser**) with **Open in browser** and **Copy link** instead of **Log in**. Generic error is **Something went wrong. Please try again.** A leftover session whose GET `/me` is the wrong-account 403 shows **You signed in with a different account. Try again with the right one.** Both errors are terminal until **Try again**. On idle, choice, unknown, error, and wrong-account, when the phone reports iOS below 18, the card shows a muted line with the installed version and that sign-in needs at least iOS 18. A new account that cannot finish uses that sentence as the alert and does not create an account. When the phone reports Android below 9, those same five variants show a muted line with the installed version and that sign-in needs at least Android 9, and a new account that cannot finish uses that sentence as the alert and does not create an account. Desktop pictures of those five variants omit the muted line. Phone pictures of those five include it, because those baselines use an iPhone user agent below iOS 18. Those phone pictures are the iPhone baselines, not Android, and the Android alert is variant android-version. The name, name-invalid, and name-taken pictures do not show that muted line. After success the visitor goes to `/setup/name`, `/setup/username`, `/setup/address`, `/setup/rules`, or `/welcome`. The recovery phrase is not part of that path.
- **Actions:** Change language. Log in with an existing passkey. After `NotAllowedError`, choose an existing account or open a new one. In an in-app browser: open the page in the system browser or copy the link.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `HomeWordmark`, `LoginCard`, `OnboardingGate`, `usePasskeyLogin`, `useAuthStore`, `LanguageSwitcher`, `isInAppBrowser`, `iosPasskeyBlock`, `androidPasskeyBlock`, `openInSystemBrowser`.

### Variant: idle

Logged out. Heading **Log in with your device**, one **Log in** button. On iOS below 18 a muted line under the heading names the installed version and the iOS 18 minimum. Desktop pictures omit that line. Phone pictures include it. Android below 9 shows the same kind of muted line in the product, while these pictures stay the iPhone baselines.

![21.gifts login idle](images/login.png)

### Variant: starting

Transient after a login click, before the ceremony finishes: spinner and **Preparing your login…**.

![21.gifts login starting](images/login-starting.png)

### Variant: error

Login begin or finish failed. Copy **Something went wrong. Please try again.** (`login.error`) and **Try again**. Phone pictures also show the muted installed-iOS line. An old-iOS register that cannot finish is variant ios-version, not this picture. No account is created there.

![21.gifts login error](images/login-error.png)

### Variant: ios-version

**Open a new account** opens the name form even on iOS below 18. After a valid name is submitted and the create ceremony is dismissed, the alert is exactly **iOS 17.5.1 is installed. Sign-in needs at least iOS 18.** Button **Try again**. The muted status line is then not also shown. No account is created.

![21.gifts login ios version](images/login-ios-version.png)

### Variant: android-version

**Open a new account** opens the name form even on Android below 9. After a valid name is submitted and the create ceremony is dismissed, the alert is exactly **Android 8.1.0 is installed. Sign-in needs at least Android 9.** Button **Try again**. The muted status line is then not also shown. No account is created.

![21.gifts login android version](images/login-android-version.png)

### Variant: wrong-account

GET `/me` 403 with the api wrong-account copy, or passkey finish with that same api string. Alert **You signed in with a different account. Try again with the right one.** (`login.wrongAccount`) and **Try again**. Phone pictures also show the muted installed-iOS line. The leftover session is cleared so the visitor is not left signed in. **Try again** starts authenticate-first login.

![21.gifts login wrong-account](images/login-wrong-account.png)

### Variant: unknown

Passkey authenticate finish 400 `{ "error": "Unknown credential" }`. Heading **This passkey is not an account** (`login.unknownHeading`), muted sentence **This phone offered a passkey that 21.gifts does not recognize. Open a new account. If the phone offers that same passkey again, delete the saved 21.gifts passkey in your password settings, then try again.** (`login.unknownBody`), primary **Open a new account** and secondary **Try again**. **Open a new account** opens the name form. It does not start create immediately. Phone pictures also show the installed-iOS line. **Try again** starts authenticate-first login and does not create an account. Dismissing the create ceremony returns to the name form, not to this card. Dismissing the Try again login prompt stays on this card and does not open the account-choice card.

![21.gifts login unknown](images/login-unknown.png)

### Variant: choice

After **Log in**, the browser reports `NotAllowedError` (no discoverable passkey, or the visitor dismissed the picker). Heading **Do you already have an account?** with labeled **Log in with existing account** and **Open a new account**. Creating an account starts only after the name form, not on the choice click. **Open a new account** opens the name form. Phone pictures also show the muted installed-iOS line. On iOS below 18 the name form still opens, and submitting a valid name does not complete create; the card then shows the version sentence as the alert.

![21.gifts login choice](images/login-choice.png)

### Variant: name

Heading **Choose your name**. This name is saved in the passkey. It is also your account name and your 21.gifts username. Use 1–32 characters: letters, digits, hyphen, underscore, or dot. It is stored in lowercase. Label **Name**, Button **Continue**. The muted iOS or Android line is not shown.

![21.gifts login name](images/login-name.png)

### Variant: name-invalid

Pressing Continue with an empty name, or a name that after trim and lowercase does not match `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,31}$/` (a lone underscore and a leading dot are rejected), stays on this form. Alert: Use 1–32 characters: a-z, 0-9, hyphen, underscore, or dot. (`login.nameInvalid`). The passkey dialog does not open. The muted iOS or Android line is not shown.

![21.gifts login name invalid](images/login-name-invalid.png)

### Variant: name-taken

A valid name whose username is already in use stays on this form. Alert: That username is already in use. (`login.nameTaken`). When registration begin reports that, the passkey dialog does not open. When registration finish reports the same text after the dialog, this form shows the same alert. The muted iOS or Android line is not shown.

![21.gifts login name taken](images/login-name-taken.png)

### Variant: in-app

Telegram or another in-app WebView detected. Heading **Open this page in your browser**; no **Log in** button; **Open in browser** and **Copy link** instead.

![21.gifts login in-app](images/login-in-app.png)

### Variant: language-open

Open the light language switcher top-right. Custom listbox with endonym rows (English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino) — not a native OS select.

![21.gifts login language](images/login-language.png)

## Screen: /donate

- **URL:** `/donate` — public, no auth gate.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` with `HomeWordmark` and the light language switcher inside the rounded sheet; the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; wordmark the localized public home when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated — not marketing header). Heading **Help someone**, short lead about writing a reaction under a post with an amount and paying from your wallet, CTA **Open the forum** (`/welcome`). No address/amount form. No QR.
- **Actions:** Change language. Open the forum. Unsigned visitors hitting `/welcome` are sent to `/login` by OnboardingGate.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `HomeWordmark`, `DonatePage`, `ButtonLink`, `LanguageSwitcher`.

### Variant: default

Heading **Help someone**, explainer lead, **Open the forum**.

![21.gifts donate](images/donate.png)

## Screen: /pl

- **URL:** `/pl?lightning=LNURL…` — public, no auth gate. `/pl` without a usable link stays on this page and does not 404.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` with `HomeWordmark` and the light language switcher inside the rounded sheet; the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none). The shop sticker's storefront sits above the person's name, which is the only heading. With no open payment, under it an **Amount** field and **Continue**. The field has the ₿ / fiat switch, and the other unit sits under it. With no account the switch starts at ₿ and is not stored. There is no **Pay** and no invoice QR. When a payment is active, either because `GET /pay/:username` returned an unexpired `charge` or because **Continue** minted an invoice, that amount field and **Continue** are gone. The page shows the same active payment: five minutes left, the sat amount, the viewer's default fiat beside it, and **Pay**. **Pay** is the width of the invoice QR plate (232px plus its padding and border), centered, not the width of the page. The fiat code is the profile cookie when set, otherwise the language default. Desktop shows the Bitcoin invoice QR only while that payment is active. A smartphone (`isSmartphoneUserAgent`, not viewport) never shows it. A bad link shows the gift glyph and **This payment link is not valid.** and no form.
- **Actions:** With no open payment, type a whole number and press **Continue** (`forum.payContinue`). An empty or non-whole amount shows **Enter a whole number.** and keeps the form. A positive PHP amount while the gift-day request has not returned shows **The PHP exchange rate is still loading.** and keeps the form; when the request then settles, that loading alert changes in place without another press and without creating the payment: **No PHP exchange rate yet.** when the currency still cannot be priced, **Enter a whole number.** when the amount is not a safe sat count inside the bounds that button already uses, and the alert goes away when it is; after that request settles, a positive PHP amount when no gift day can price PHP shows **No PHP exchange rate yet.** and keeps the form. `{code}` in the product is the preferred fiat; these variants use PHP. Success leaves that form and shows the active payment: the locked sat amount, the viewer's default fiat beside it, and **Pay** (`forum.payOpenWallet`, aria **Pay with Wallet of Satoshi**), which sets `location.href` to the Wallet of Satoshi link (Android Intent on Android). An open till mints that exact amount with no amount step. **Pay** opens Wallet of Satoshi. Desktop shows the Bitcoin invoice QR. A smartphone does not. A failed mint on an open till keeps the charge and shows **Could not create the invoice.**; **Pay** tries the mint again. A failed **Continue** keeps the amount form and shows the same sentence. Change language from the header.
- **Calls:** `PayLinkPage`, `PayLinkScreen`, `PageChrome`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `HomeWordmark`, `LanguageSwitcher`, `payLinkUsername`, `GET /pay/[username]`, `POST /pay/[username]/invoice`.

### Variant: default

Scanned pay link with no open payment (`charge` null or absent). The shop sticker, the person's name, the amount field, and **Continue**. No countdown, no **Pay**, and no invoice QR.

![21.gifts pay link](images/pl.png)

### Variant: invoice

After **Continue**, the same active payment as an open till: the shop sticker, five minutes left, the locked sat amount, the viewer's default fiat beside it, and **Pay**. No amount field. Desktop shows the Bitcoin invoice QR. A smartphone shows the countdown and **Pay**, not the QR.

![21.gifts pay link invoice](images/pl-invoice.png)

### Variant: amount-invalid

**Continue** with an empty or non-whole amount shows **Enter a whole number.** The form stays. No **Pay**.

![21.gifts pay link amount invalid](images/pl-amount-invalid.png)

### Variant: rate-loading

PHP is pressed and the amount is 100. **Continue** while the gift-day request has not returned. Alert **The PHP exchange rate is still loading.** The form stays. No **Pay**.

![21.gifts pay link rate loading](images/pl-rate-loading.png)

### Variant: no-rate

PHP is pressed and the amount is 100. The gift-day request has settled and no day can price PHP. **Continue** shows **No PHP exchange rate yet.** The form stays. No **Pay**.

![21.gifts pay link no rate](images/pl-no-rate.png)

### Variant: invalid

The gift glyph and **This payment link is not valid.** No amount field.

![21.gifts pay link invalid](images/pl-invalid.png)

### Variant: failed

The form stays, and **Could not create the invoice.** is shown under it.

![21.gifts pay link failed](images/pl-failed.png)

### Variant: charge

The open till: the shop sticker's storefront above the name, then time left, the sat amount, the viewer's default fiat beside it, and **Pay**. Desktop also shows the Bitcoin invoice QR. A smartphone does not. No gift glyph and no amount field.

![21.gifts pay link charge](images/pl-charge.png)

### Variant: charge-failed

Open till, mint failed. The shop sticker, time left, the sat amount, the viewer's default fiat beside it, **Could not create the invoice.**, and **Pay**. No invoice QR. **Pay** tries the mint again.

![21.gifts pay link charge failed](images/pl-charge-failed.png)

## Screen: /setup/rules

- **URL:** `/setup/rules` — when living-room rules are not yet agreed (`account.setup === 'rules'`). Name, username, and address may already be done; username cannot be skipped; rules cannot be skipped.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (wordmark is a non-link span, plus Menu). Chapter 0 shows one arrow that returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. Later chapters replace it with the previous-chapter arrow. One arrow.

- **Actions:** Read the current chapter and **Continue** to advance. Chapter 0's arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. Later chapters use that same arrow for the previous chapter. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Changing chapter (Continue or Back) scrolls the fill inner scroller back to the top. The last **I agree to these rules** POSTs agreement, then the visitor is sent to `/welcome`. Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**.

![21.gifts rules setup error](images/setup-rules-error.png)

### Variant: busy

Last-chapter POST in flight. Agree disabled with a spinner; **Our house** still visible.

## Screen: /welcome

- **URL:** `/welcome` — when `account.setup` is null (name and address may be saved or skipped; username is required; living-room rules agreement is required). New passkey accounts reach this after name, username, address, and rules. The phrase is not on that path.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header. The top-left arrow is omitted only when this tab has no earlier in-app view; otherwise it returns to that view. An ask step uses that same slot. The wordmark is not that control. Menu sits inside the rounded sheet. Content scrolls inside the frame. Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**, then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`). Gift icon with an integrated Bitcoin symbol, **Welcome, {name}** when the account has a name, or **Welcome** with no session and no empty "Welcome, ". A signed-out visit keeps the wordmark, shows **Log in**, and does not show the member menu. Each note still shows its bitcoin amount. The active list loads without Authorization. Another forum mode, or a later page that returns 401, opens `/login`. No composer, reaction form, pay, or delete while signed out. **Show reactions** still loads public replies. A resolved `@username` opens that member only when a session exists; without a session the mark stays text. An author name with a non-empty `accountId` is the profile button even without a session. dismissible living-room laws hint box with an X when not yet dismissed on the account (two laws plus links to **Living room rules** `/rules` and **Contact** `/contact`; after dismiss the box is gone and the flag persists on the account), then a `ForumModeSelect` dropdown (**Active** / **No gifts yet** / **All** / **Most popular**), default **Active**, not a four-way SegmentedControl and not a two-column grid. First paint is one page of 20 notes for the selected mode; further cursor pages prefetch near the end of the visible list. Page-one polling does not replace older loaded pages. **No gifts yet** shows a count chip on the closed control for loaded zero-sat notes created after the last time that filter was opened; omitted when the count is 0 or the filter is selected. Default is **Active** (paid notes (`sats` > 0) plus unpaid moderator notes; a top-level ask with `goalSats` > 0 and zero sats is not included, newest-first feed: newest at the top). **All** shows every note newest-first. **Most popular** ranks paid notes by sats (highest first). Below the selector: clickable author name when `accountId` is set (opens `/members/:id`), including without a session; without `accountId` the name stays text, optional Founder / Moderator / Initiator / Verified pill when the api `role` is one of those four (`basis` has no pill), a `#Shop` link to `/shops` on top-level shop notes (raw `#21GiftsShop` hidden); a moderator also sees **Edit shop note** on each of those notes and can open the same five steps as on `/shops`, timestamp, optional inline photo then caption text below the photo, a link to `/map?pin=<id>` (the label, or coordinates when the label is null) on a top-level note that has a place, optional inline `<video>` playback for notes with video (player follows the clip aspect — portrait stays portrait; the player has its own fullscreen button, including a narrow portrait clip); note and reply bodies longer than 560 characters (twice the 280-character preview) show a 280-character collapsed preview, an ellipsis, and inline **Show more** (`forum.showMore`), expanding in place with no Show less, while permalink `/messages/[id]` stays full text. Cards also show ₿ amount always, plus optional preferred-fiat `·` from the amount stored when the payment was made (a stored string as-is; a null or missing field uses the gift-day rate) (no FiatPicker), replyCount text, React (`forum.react`, lucide Reply) on every top-level note, copy-link control (**Copy link to this note** → origin `/l/<8 hex>` (first group of that note id); nested replies get their own copy control, **Copy link to this reply** → origin `/l/<8 hex>` (first group of that reply id)), and expand/collapse on the card body (**Show reactions** / **Hide reactions**; the footer ₿ amount and the reaction-count text also expand; React expands a collapsed card and does not collapse an expanded one; Gift on a payable reply / role / copy / delete / Translate do not; the card body remains the unique **Show reactions** / **Hide reactions** name). Expanded cards show the replies list (Gift on a payable reply, copy, and moderator trash are also on nested replies) plus an in-card reply composer (**Write a reaction** and an **Amount** field with the ₿ / fiat switch and the other unit under it; the last choice is `account.amountUnit`; empty reply text and an empty amount invoices 21 sats (pay-sheet default); a reply with text and an empty amount is unpaid for a verified member, otherwise 1 sat to 21.gifts on the composer slot (`payHost: composer`); extra gifts stay on the card (`payHost: card`); an amount of 0 is billed as 1 sat); reply authors show the same Founder / Moderator / Initiator / Verified pills (`basis` has none). Pay control / Send Bitcoin only on a payable reply (open **Show reactions**, then Gift on that reply — never on the post); composer under the filters: **Send a post** / **Ask for money** pill, then Post-path **Add a photo or video** (ImagePlus) and **Add a place** (MapPin) left of the textarea, **Post** (Send icon) to the right (Ask path is `ForumAskWizard`), optional photo draft preview with **Remove photo** (X icon), and optional video draft preview with **Remove video** (X icon) — icon-only action controls, catalog `aria-label`s, no visible button text. Top-level notes with `goalSats` show `ForumGoalBar`: **Ask**, then the defined fiat amount only when the ask was defined in fiat, then `formatBitcoin(goalSats)`, then the visitor's default fiat unless the ask was defined in that same fiat. That visitor figure is the stored snapshot when the string is present, otherwise the gift-day rate. A legacy ask is bitcoin plus that same visitor figure. Then orange 0–100, green overflow, uncapped percent. A missing name, username, Lightning Address, or rules agreement opens `RequirementsOverlay` (no Skip) before a post or reply retries. No always-visible refresh control; there is no visible refresh chrome — while refreshing or pull-armed only a visually hidden (`sr-only`) `role="status"` (`forum.refreshing`) is mounted, and idle markup has no status node. When the visitor is scrolled down and a silent refresh found new ids, a labeled **New posts** pill appears over the feed; it is absent from idle screenshots. When an unread `moderator_appointed` notification exists, a labeled **You are a moderator** pill uses the same chrome (sticky under the frame header); if both pills show, appointment stays at `top-2` and **New posts** moves to `top-14`. Clicking the appointment pill marks that row read and stays on `/welcome`; it is omitted when the flag is falsy and absent from idle screenshots. While the tab is visible the list also silent-refetches every 30 seconds (`FORUM_LIST_POLL_MS`); hidden tabs do not poll. Clicking a role pill toggles a short explanation under that card header. Paying a payable reply opens a sheet with a Close (`X`) control, not Back, and a **Pay** button that includes the Wallet of Satoshi icon. On a computer the sheet also shows a QR; on a smartphone there is no QR. No name or address form. No guest donate CTA. Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false. **Translate** (Languages icon) sits in the footer icon row with react / copy; **Show original** / **Show translation** stay the same Languages icon, with no visible text. Offered when the note language differs from the UI locale.
- **Actions:** Dismiss the living-room laws hint (permanent), post a text and/or photo or video message, attach/remove a photo, a video, or a place draft, expand a note to load replies and post a reply, open an author profile at `/members/:id`, open a `#Shop` tag to `/shops`, edit a shop note when the session is a moderator, copy a note link or a reply's own link to origin `/l/<8 hex>` (first group of that note or reply id), click a role pill for its explanation, pay a payable reply in-app, switch the forum view (Active / No gifts yet / All / Most popular), pull down from the top to refresh the forum list, click **You are a moderator** to mark that appointment read and hide the pill, click **New posts** or the wordmark / Menu **Home** (already on `/welcome`) to scroll to top and apply new notes, leave the forum in view for 30 seconds so a visible-tab poll can pick up new ids, return to the web app to refresh the list when it becomes visible again, complete a `RequirementsOverlay` for a missing name, username, Wallet of Satoshi address, or rules agreement, open the rules or contact pages, retry a failed load; open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**, then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`); dismiss `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` for this mount (Close) or **Write an introduction** (dismisses, focuses the welcome composer via `requestForumCompose` / `FORUM_COMPOSE_EVENT`; `router.push('/welcome')` only when the path is not already `/welcome`).
- **Calls:** `PageChrome`, `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `ForumHomeWordmark`, `WelcomeScreen`, `ForumLoader`, `ForumBoard`, `ShopNoteEditControl`, `ForumModeSelect`, `ForumAskWizard`, `ForumGoalBar`, `parseForumAskAmount`, `RequirementsOverlay`, `SegmentedControl`, `WelcomeTopRight`, `SignedInChrome`, `IntroduceYourselfOverlay`, `OnboardingGate`, `prepareForumPhoto`, `prepareForumVideo`, `fetchMessagePhoto`, `forumVideoSrc`, `fetchReplies`, `visibleForumMessages`, `hasUnseenForumPosts`, `unpaidNewCount`, `fetchGiftStats`, `latestRateDay`, `satsToFiatAmount`, `fetchNotifications`, `markNotificationRead`.

### Variant: default

Gift icon with an integrated Bitcoin symbol, **Welcome, Ada**, without the living-room laws hint (`forumLawsDismissed`), **Active** selected. Paid notes newest-first (Ada ₿5 then Carol ₿21); Bob's unpaid note is not visible. Composer is **Send a post** / **Ask for money**; Post is attach + Send icons, no Ask field on the Post messenger. React (`forum.react`) on every top-level note. Posts do not show Send Bitcoin; Gift appears on a payable reply after **Show reactions**. Founder / Moderator / Initiator / Verified pills beside the name when `role` is one of those four; `basis` has no pill (Carol is `verified`, Ada is `moderator`; Bob is `basis` and hidden on Active). One **Menu** top-right; open it for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**.

![21.gifts welcome](images/welcome.png)

### Variant: software-developer

One author row on the welcome forum. Beside the name, a static Software Developer label (a span, not a button and not a role) sits after any role pill. The rest of this state matches the smallest one-note welcome screen.

![21.gifts welcome software developer](images/welcome-software-developer.png)

### Variant: daily-payout-stopped

Signed in, no grant application. The notice title is **Daily payout stopped**, then **Applications are currently paused. You can apply again when shop transactions have increased.**, then the link `https://21.gifts/statistics`. No apply control. The living room underneath is the default welcome.

![21.gifts welcome daily payout stopped](images/welcome-daily-payout-stopped.png)

### Variant: daily-payout-stopped-apply

Username joey-rosima, of any role, sees the Apply link under Daily payout stopped, not the paused sentence. That link is not the apply walk.

![21.gifts welcome daily payout stopped apply](images/welcome-daily-payout-stopped-apply.png)

### Variant: renew

Signed in, no seed yet. The dialog explains that the device will ask for a passkey and that nothing changes until the member confirms. **Continue** is the only action. There is no close control.

![21.gifts welcome renew](images/welcome-renew.png)

### Variant: renew-passkey

After **Continue**. The dialog says the device is showing the passkey prompt. The member confirms that prompt on the device. There is no second button.

![21.gifts welcome renew passkey](images/welcome-renew-passkey.png)

### Variant: renew-ok

The passkey was renewed. The dialog says it worked. **OK** closes it and the living room is usable.

![21.gifts welcome renew ok](images/welcome-renew-ok.png)

### Variant: renew-failed

The renewal did not work. **OK** confirms that and closes the dialog. The renew does not start again. The account still has no seed.

![21.gifts welcome renew failed](images/welcome-renew-failed.png)

### Variant: renew-failed-prf-unsupported

The renewal did not work because this passkey cannot create a recovery phrase. The dialog says another password manager or another device is needed. **OK** confirms that and closes the dialog. The renew does not start again. The account still has no seed.

![21.gifts welcome renew failed prf unsupported](images/welcome-renew-failed-prf-unsupported.png)

### Variant: sunday

Device-local Sunday. The public composer is gone. The sentence **Writing is paused on Sunday.** stands in its place. Notes stay readable.

### Variant: signed-out

No session. Heading **Welcome**, wordmark, **Log in**, no member menu. Each note still shows its bitcoin amount. The active list is the public page. An author name with `accountId` is the profile button. No composer.

![21.gifts welcome reply mention suggestions](images/welcome-mention-suggest-reply.png)

### Variant: mention-suggest-ask

Ask for money is on the text step, the message contains `@`, and the People list is open.

![21.gifts welcome ask mention suggestions](images/welcome-mention-suggest-ask.png)

### Variant: mention-inserted

![21.gifts welcome ask mention inserted](images/welcome-mention-inserted-ask.png)

### Variant: laws

First visit: the dismissible living-room laws hint box is visible (two laws plus links to **Living room rules** and **Contact**). Idle screenshots after dismiss omit it.

![21.gifts welcome laws](images/welcome-laws.png)

### Variant: moderation

A moderator sees an icon-only Delete post control in the note footer icon row with copy; confirming wraps to the next line. Other roles do not see it. The server independently checks the live role.

![21.gifts moderation](images/welcome-moderation.png)

### Variant: delete-confirm

Delete post opens an inline confirmation: Delete this post and its reactions from 21.gifts? Confirm deletion (check) and Cancel deletion (X) are icon-only controls. Cancel sends no request.

![21.gifts delete-confirm](images/welcome-delete-confirm.png)

### Variant: deleting

![21.gifts deleting](images/welcome-deleting.png)

### Variant: delete-error

A failed deletion keeps the post and confirmation visible with an error and retry. Already missing posts (404) are removed from the local view.

![21.gifts delete-error](images/welcome-delete-error.png)

A moderator who expands a note sees an icon-only Delete reaction control on each nested reply. Ordinary members do not. Parent still has Delete post.
![21.gifts reply-moderation](images/welcome-reply-moderation.png)

### Variant: reply-delete-confirm

Delete reaction opens inline confirmation: Delete this reaction from 21.gifts? Confirm deletion (check) and Cancel deletion (X) are icon-only. Cancel sends no request. The parent post stays.

![21.gifts reply-delete-confirm](images/welcome-reply-delete-confirm.png)

### Variant: reply-deleting

While DELETE of the reply is pending, confirmation and cancellation on that reply are disabled and a spinner replaces the check.

![21.gifts reply-deleting](images/welcome-reply-deleting.png)

![21.gifts reply-delete-error](images/welcome-reply-delete-error.png)

### Variant: all

Click **All** — Bob's unpaid note (`Does anyone have spare sats this week?`) is visible with Ada and Carol; list order newest-first (Ada, Carol, Bob).

A **Donation** tag sits beside the name. Pressing it explains that a donation is not paid back. The bar does not repeat that sentence. Composer **Send a post** / **Ask for money** pill visible. Gift still not on the post.

![21.gifts welcome goal 50](images/welcome-goal-50.png)

### Variant: goal-100

![21.gifts welcome goal 100](images/welcome-goal-100.png)

![21.gifts welcome ask open](images/welcome-ask-open.png)

### Variant: filter-open

The forum view dropdown is open on the default Active feed. **Active** is checked. **No gifts yet**, **All**, and **Most popular** are listed under it. The list stays open.

![21.gifts welcome filter open](images/welcome-filter-open.png)

### Variant: unpaid

Click **No gifts yet** (German: **Noch ohne Geschenk**) — only loaded notes with exactly zero sats appear. Bob is visible; paid Ada and Carol are hidden. This includes notes without a receiving wallet. The four filters are a dropdown; Active is shown closed; open it and choose **No gifts yet**. Active remains the default.

![21.gifts welcome without gifts](images/welcome-unpaid.png)

### Variant: unpaid-new-count

Active is shown closed; last-visit stamp older than Bob's unpaid note; the count chip `1` sits on that closed control.

![21.gifts welcome unpaid new count](images/welcome-unpaid-new-count.png)

### Variant: empty-unpaid

No zero-sat notes remain in the loaded list. **Every loaded message has already received Bitcoin.** appears; the filters and composer remain available. An entirely empty forum still uses the general empty state.

![21.gifts welcome no remaining zero-sat notes](images/welcome-empty-unpaid.png)

![21.gifts welcome ask daily error](images/welcome-error-ask-daily.png)

### Variant: expanded

On **All**, click **Show reactions** on a note — the note's ₿ amount and the reaction-count text also expand — card expands (`aria-expanded`), replies list loads via `fetchReplies`, and the in-card reply composer shows **Write a reaction** plus an **Amount** sats field. Gift-only replies render as **send ₿…** plus the same optional preferred-fiat `·` as notes (a stored string as-is, the gift-day rate when that stored field is null or missing); a reply with text and a gift shows both. Reply authors show the same Founder / Moderator / Initiator / Verified pills as notes (`basis` has none); clicking a pill toggles the same short explanation. Empty reply text and an empty amount invoices 21 sats (pay-sheet default) and opens the pay sheet; a reply with text and an empty amount is unpaid for a verified member, otherwise 1 sat to 21.gifts; an amount of 0 is billed as 1 sat.

![21.gifts welcome expanded](images/welcome-expanded.png)

### Variant: expanded-gifts

On **All**, expand Ada's note. The thread shows a gift-only reply (**send ₿21**) and a text reply with the gift amount under the body. The in-card composer still has **Write a reaction** and **Amount**.

![21.gifts welcome expanded gifts](images/welcome-expanded-gifts.png)

### Variant: expanded-received

On **All**, expand Ada's note. Cyrill's reply **You got it right.** shows two lines under a left rule: **sent ₿21'000 · $18.14** and **received ₿100 · $0.09**. The note footer is **₿21'000 · $18.14**, the same gift as the sent line, not a second payment. The later **₿100** is not added to either figure.

![21.gifts welcome expanded received](images/welcome-expanded-received.png)

### Variant: expanded-donated

Expand Ada's note. Cyrill's reply has no text. It shows **send ₿21'000 · $18.14** and no received line. The note footer is **₿21'000 · $18.14**, the same gift, not a second payment. Nothing on this reply is added into ₿21'100.

![21.gifts welcome expanded donated](images/welcome-expanded-donated.png)

### Variant: expanded-text

Expand Ada's note. Cyrill's reply is the sentence **You got it right.** It sent nothing and received nothing, so no amount line sits under the sentence. The note footer is **₿0**, because this reply did not add a gift. Ada stays on the feed because she is a moderator.

![21.gifts welcome expanded text](images/welcome-expanded-text.png)

### Variant: expanded-received-only

Expand Ada's note. Cyrill's reply **You got it right.** sent nothing. Under the sentence is only **received ₿100 · $0.09**. That 100 is not the note total. The note footer stays **₿0**.

![21.gifts welcome expanded received only](images/welcome-expanded-received-only.png)

### Variant: expanded-external

On **All**, expand Ada's note. The thread shows two replies from **Robin**, who has no 21.gifts account: a gift-only reply (**send ₿69**) and a text reply containing `https://example.com/hello`. Each author line shows an **External** button next to the name (same slot as a role pill); clicking it opens a short hint that the person wrote from another app, not from a 21.gifts account, and is shown because they sent bitcoin to a post. The name itself is a **View profile** button that opens `/messages/<id>/author`. This shot stays on the thread. The URL is visible as plain text — not a clickable link, no autolink, no quoted-note embed.

![21.gifts welcome expanded external](images/welcome-expanded-external.png)

### Variant: reaction-draft

On **Active**, expand Bob's note. Ada, a basis member, has typed **21** in **Amount** (the line under it shows **$0.02**) and **This is my answer** in **Your reaction**. Bob's note and the existing **21.gifts** reply stay on screen. **Post** is still enabled.

![21.gifts welcome reaction draft](images/welcome-reaction-draft.png)

### Variant: reaction-submitting

Same draft, with the payment request still in flight. The reply **Post** control is disabled and shows its spinner. The typed sentence and **21** stay in the fields.

![21.gifts welcome reaction submitting](images/welcome-reaction-submitting.png)

### Variant: reaction-pay

The invoice has been minted. The pay page stands where the reply field was. The note stays in the window. The page previews **This is my answer**. The reply field is gone.

![21.gifts welcome reaction pay](images/welcome-reaction-pay.png)

### Variant: reaction-pay-sheet

The same page, scrolled so **Close** (`X`), **Pay ₿21**, the QR or the phone **Pay** button, and **Waiting for payment…** are in the window. The preview is on that page. Close stays on this view and is not the top-left back arrow.

![21.gifts welcome reaction pay sheet](images/welcome-reaction-pay-sheet.png)

### Variant: reaction-pay-kept

The same page. The sentence is a preview, not a disabled **Your reaction** field, and there is no **Amount** field.

![21.gifts welcome reaction pay kept](images/welcome-reaction-pay-kept.png)

### Variant: reaction-error

The payment request failed. The alert says **Could not post your message**. The typed sentence is still in the field, and no pay sheet is open.

![21.gifts welcome reaction error](images/welcome-reaction-error.png)

### Variant: reaction-deleted

The payment request failed because the note was deleted. The alert says **This note was deleted.**, the typed sentence is still in the field, and no pay sheet is open.

![21.gifts welcome reaction deleted](images/welcome-reaction-deleted.png)

### Variant: reaction-rate-limit

The payment request was rate-limited. The alert says **Too many messages. Please wait a moment and try again.** The typed sentence is still in the field.

![21.gifts welcome reaction rate limit](images/welcome-reaction-rate-limit.png)

### Variant: reaction-paid

The payment was detected. Ada's reply **This is my answer** is in the thread, and the composer is empty again.

![21.gifts welcome reaction paid](images/welcome-reaction-paid.png)

### Variant: quoted-note

Signed-in founder Cyrill, living-room laws dismissed, Active. Only Riana Rosello's paid 21-sat verified note is in the list; the card is expanded. Cyrill's reply shows `just for information:` and a nested technical-note post (photo, caption starting **A Quick Technical Note**, Founder pill, ₿43). The raw `https://21.gifts/messages/d8cd22dd-d5c4-46a8-82ed-38b4d2f551ec` URL is not visible.

![21.gifts welcome quoted note](images/welcome-quoted-note.png)

### Variant: copy

Click **Copy link to this note** — control sets `data-copied` after writing `origin /l/<8 hex>` (first group of that note id) to the clipboard.

![21.gifts welcome copy](images/welcome-copy.png)

### Variant: reply-copy

Signed-in `/welcome` on the default filter; expand Ada's note to show its reply.

- **Trigger:** Click **Copy link to this reply** on a nested reply.
- **Result:** The control sets `data-copied` on that reply's own button after writing the reply's own `origin /l/<8 hex>` (first group of that reply id) permalink to the clipboard — the note's own copy button is unaffected.
- **Scope:** Every reply row has this control regardless of whether Gift or moderator delete are also visible on that row.

![21.gifts welcome reply copy](images/welcome-reply-copy.png)

### Variant: translate

Signed-in `/welcome` with one paid German note. **Translate** is visible in the footer icon row with react / copy. English notes on other fixtures still hide it.

![21.gifts welcome translate](images/welcome-translate.png)

### Variant: translate-loading

Same German note after clicking **Translate** while POST `/translate` hangs. The control is busy (`aria-busy`) with a spinner.

![21.gifts welcome translate loading](images/welcome-translate-loading.png)

### Variant: translate-done

Same German note after a successful translation. Translated body plus **Show original**; the German original is not shown.

![21.gifts welcome translate done](images/welcome-translate-done.png)

### Variant: translate-hidden

After **Show original**: translated body hidden, the Languages icon is named **Show translation** and has no visible text.

![21.gifts welcome translate hidden](images/welcome-translate-hidden.png)

### Variant: translate-error

Same German note after POST /translate fails. Alert **Could not translate this note. Please try again.** and the Translate control remains.

![21.gifts welcome translate error](images/welcome-translate-error.png)

### Variant: note-truncated

Signed-in `/welcome` with one paid note whose body is longer than 560 characters. Collapsed 280-character preview, ellipsis, and **Show more** are visible; the distinctive tail is hidden.

![21.gifts welcome note truncated](images/welcome-note-truncated.png)

### Variant: note-whole

Signed-in `/welcome` with one paid note longer than the 280-character preview and at most 560 characters. The whole body is visible, including the distinctive tail. **Show more** is absent.

![21.gifts welcome note whole](images/welcome-note-whole.png)

### Variant: note-video-paused

Signed-in /welcome with one note whose text is **A clip** and whose picture is a video. The play button and the fullscreen button sit on that picture. The picture is centered.

![21.gifts welcome note video paused](images/welcome-note-video-paused.png)

### Variant: note-video-playing

Same note after **Play**. The play button is gone. The fullscreen button stays on the picture.

![21.gifts welcome note video playing](images/welcome-note-video-playing.png)

### Variant: translate-long-loading

Signed-in `/welcome` with one paid German note longer than 560 characters. After clicking **Translate** while POST `/translate` hangs, the original body is fully visible, including its tail, **Show more** is gone, and the control is busy.

![21.gifts welcome translate long loading](images/welcome-translate-long-loading.png)

### Variant: translate-long-done

Same long German note after a successful translation. The translated body is fully visible, including its tail. **Show more** is absent. The Languages icon is named **Show original**.

![21.gifts welcome translate long done](images/welcome-translate-long-done.png)

### Variant: new-posts

Visitor is scrolled down the forum list. A silent refresh found a newer note id. Labeled **New posts** pill is visible; the new note text is not yet in the list.

![21.gifts welcome new posts](images/welcome-new-posts.png)

### Variant: moderator-appointed

Signed-in member with an unread `moderator_appointed` notification. Labeled **You are a moderator** pill is visible under the frame header. Idle screenshots omit the pill. When **New posts** is also shown, this pill stays at `top-2` and **New posts** moves to `top-14` (not a separate variant).

![21.gifts welcome moderator appointed](images/welcome-moderator-appointed.png)

### Variant: photo

On **All** (unpaid photo-only notes are hidden on Active): photo-only forum row from Ada with inline image (**Photo from Ada**) and the attach control visible in the composer.

![21.gifts welcome photo](images/welcome-photo.png)

### Variant: photos

On **All**: photo-only forum row from Ada with two stills (**Photo from Ada** twice, `photoCount: 2`) in `ForumPhotoGallery` (horizontal snap row, `data-scroll-x`, 88% peek, `1/2` chip, dots) and the attach control visible in the composer.

![21.gifts welcome photos](images/welcome-photos.png)

### Variant: photo-and-text

After a successful post of caption **Hello with this photo.** plus a JPEG: the row shows **Photo from Ada**, then that text below the photo; the composer is empty again (attach + textarea + Post).

![21.gifts welcome photo and text](images/welcome-photo-and-text.png)

### Variant: photos-and-text

On **All**: forum row from Ada with two stills (**Photo from Ada**) in `ForumPhotoGallery` (horizontal snap row, `data-scroll-x`, 88% peek, `1/2` chip, dots) and caption **Hello with these photos.** below the photos; the composer is empty (attach + textarea + Post).

![21.gifts welcome photos and text](images/welcome-photos-and-text.png)

### Variant: composer-text

Typed caption **Caption before attaching a photo.** in the composer; no preview yet; attach + Post idle.

![21.gifts welcome composer text](images/welcome-composer-text.png)

### Variant: keyboard-viewport

Signed-in `/welcome` with the composer focused while `visualViewport.height` is 60% of `innerHeight` and `offsetTop` is 15% (iPhone Safari software-keyboard geometry). The rounded AppShell frame matches that visible height. It does not stay at `innerHeight`, so the page does not scroll under the frame.

![21.gifts welcome keyboard viewport](images/welcome-keyboard-viewport.png)

### Variant: composer-photo

JPEG preview (**Selected photo**) and **Remove photo**; textarea empty.

![21.gifts welcome composer photo](images/welcome-composer-photo.png)

### Variant: place

One unpaid note on **All** with a place. The card shows a MapPin link **Happyland** to `/map?pin=m-place`.

![21.gifts welcome place](images/welcome-place.png)

### Variant: place-coords

One unpaid note on **All** whose place has no label. The card shows a MapPin link **14.60000, 120.98000** to `/map?pin=m-place`. The same link is what a member profile and your own profile show on a top-level note.

![21.gifts welcome place coordinates](images/welcome-place-coords.png)

### Variant: composer-place

**Add a place** is open and the map key is empty, so the panel says **The map is not available.**

![21.gifts welcome composer place](images/welcome-composer-place.png)

### Variant: composer-place-map

**Add a place** is open with a map key. The map frame is visible and **Use this place** is not, because the map has not been clicked yet.

![21.gifts welcome composer place map](images/welcome-composer-place-map.png)

### Variant: composer-place-confirm

**Add a place** is open with a map. A click has set a pin, **Place name** is **Stall**, and **Use this place** is still visible. The pin is not confirmed yet.

![21.gifts welcome composer place confirm](images/welcome-composer-place-confirm.png)

### Variant: composer-place-set

A confirmed pin **Stall** sits under **Add a place** as a preview with **Remove place**. The panel is closed.

![21.gifts welcome composer place set](images/welcome-composer-place-set.png)

### Variant: composer-place-pending

**Add a place** is open, the key has arrived, and the map script has not loaded. The place name field is visible. **Use this place** is not, and the frame is still empty. A failed script or a rejected key uses the same **The map is not available.** panel as `composer-place`.

![21.gifts welcome composer place pending](images/welcome-composer-place-pending.png)

### Variant: composer-place-unlabeled

**Add a place** is open with a map. A click has set a pin and the place name is still empty. **Use this place** is visible.

![21.gifts welcome composer place unlabeled](images/welcome-composer-place-unlabeled.png)

### Variant: composer-place-set-coords

A confirmed pin with no name sits under **Add a place** as **14.50000, 120.90000** with **Remove place**. The panel is closed.

![21.gifts welcome composer place set coordinates](images/welcome-composer-place-set-coords.png)

### Variant: composer-photos

Two JPEG previews (**Selected photo**) and per-index **Remove photo**; textarea empty.

![21.gifts welcome composer photos](images/welcome-composer-photos.png)

### Variant: composer-photo-and-text

Preview plus caption **Caption with selected photo.**, ready to Post.

![21.gifts welcome composer photo and text](images/welcome-composer-photo-and-text.png)

### Variant: composer-photos-and-text

Two JPEG previews plus caption **Caption with selected photos.**, ready to Post.

![21.gifts welcome composer photos and text](images/welcome-composer-photos-and-text.png)

### Variant: composer-video

MP4 preview in the composer and **Remove video**; textarea empty.

![21.gifts welcome composer video](images/welcome-composer-video.png)

### Variant: composer-video-and-text

Video preview plus caption **Caption with selected video.**, ready to Post.

![21.gifts welcome composer video and text](images/welcome-composer-video-and-text.png)

### Variant: composer-text-after-remove

After **Remove photo**, caption **Caption kept after removing photo.** remains; preview gone.

![21.gifts welcome composer text after remove](images/welcome-composer-text-after-remove.png)

### Variant: preparing-photo

Attach in flight (Post disabled + spinner, no preview yet). Native file picker is OS chrome and is not a variant.

![21.gifts welcome preparing photo](images/welcome-preparing-photo.png)

### Variant: preparing-photo-and-text

Same spinner, caption **Caption while the photo is preparing.** already in the textarea.

![21.gifts welcome preparing photo and text](images/welcome-preparing-photo-and-text.png)

### Variant: posting-photo-and-text

Post in flight: spinner on **Post**, composer disabled, preview and caption **Caption while the post is in flight.** still shown.

![21.gifts welcome posting photo and text](images/welcome-posting-photo-and-text.png)

### Variant: photo-loading

Forum row for Ada with caption **Caption waiting for the photo to load.** and `hasPhoto`, image bytes not yet loaded so no `<img>`. A failed photo fetch looks the same (text-only row) — not a separate variant.

![21.gifts welcome photo loading](images/welcome-photo-loading.png)

### Variant: error-unsupported

Attach a GIF → **Use a JPEG, PNG, or WebP photo, or an MP4, WebM, or MOV video**.

![21.gifts welcome error unsupported](images/welcome-error-unsupported.png)

### Variant: error-unsupported-with-text

Same alert with caption **Caption with an unsupported photo.** still in the composer.

![21.gifts welcome error unsupported with text](images/welcome-error-unsupported-with-text.png)

### Variant: error-too-large

Encoded JPEG over 1 MB → **Keep photos under 1 MB and videos under 32 MB**.

![21.gifts welcome error too large](images/welcome-error-too-large.png)

### Variant: error-too-many

Eleven files → **You can add up to 10 photos**.

![21.gifts welcome error too many](images/welcome-error-too-many.png)

### Variant: error-too-large-with-text

Same alert with caption **Caption with a photo that is too large.** still in the composer.

![21.gifts welcome error too large with text](images/welcome-error-too-large-with-text.png)

### Variant: error-too-many-with-text

Same 11-file tooMany alert with caption **Caption with too many photos.** still in the composer.

![21.gifts welcome error too many with text](images/welcome-error-too-many-with-text.png)

### Variant: error-request-photo-and-text

POST fails after caption+JPEG → **Could not post your message**; preview and caption remain.

![21.gifts welcome error request photo and text](images/welcome-error-request-photo-and-text.png)

### Variant: menu-open

Open **Menu** top-right → Menu includes **Home** first (Home, Shops, Point of sale, Profile, Grants, Wallet, Living room rules, Habit-Tracker, Trust Chain, Statistics, Notifications, Messages, Contact, optional Install, Log out, then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`)). Profile is one line (User + Profile; no given or received amounts). Notifications shows an unread count on the right only when `unreadCount` > 0 (Ada’s default shot is 0, so no count). Messages shows a count on the right only when inbox unread > 0; Ada’s default shots are 0 so no number. Ada’s default welcome-menu shot shows Profile with no amounts. Living room rules and Contact each have an icon, optional **Install app** when an install offer exists, Log out, then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`). Language, theme, and number format live on `/profile`, not in this Menu. The Profile link’s accessible name is Profile. Other accessible names are unchanged. No English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino option rows. No native language select.
![21.gifts welcome menu](images/welcome-menu.png)

### Variant: menu-lifted

Open **Menu** on a wide frame whose window is too short for the ordinary dropdown but still tall enough for the compact menu once it moves up. The panel is a fixed 18rem overlay. Its top stays inside the window, it does not scroll, and **Habit-Tracker** and **Log out** stay on screen. This is not the narrow sheet.

![21.gifts welcome menu lifted](images/welcome-menu-lifted.png)

### Variant: menu-tall-sheet

Open **Menu** on a wide frame shorter than the compact menu even with its top on the window. The wide menu uses the same full-width sheet as a narrow frame. The page underneath is hidden. The sheet does not grow its own scroll; the page scrollport reaches the lower rows.

![21.gifts welcome menu tall sheet](images/welcome-menu-tall-sheet.png)

### Variant: menu-unread

Open **Menu** with `unreadCount` 3 stubbed on `GET /forum/notifications` → Notifications shows **3** on the right (`nav.notificationsUnread`, accessible name Notifications, 3 unread). Messages shows a count on the right only when inbox unread > 0; Ada’s default inbox unread is 0 so no number. Other Menu rows match `menu-open`. The installed PWA home-screen badge is the sum of notification unread, inbox unread, and staff-room unread (0 or 1). The Menu still splits the counts (Notifications vs Messages vs Moderation).

![21.gifts welcome menu unread](images/welcome-menu-unread.png)

### Variant: menu-inbox-unread

Open **Menu** with two unread inbox rows stubbed on `GET /conversations` → Messages shows **2** on the right (`nav.inboxUnread`, accessible name Messages, 2 unread). Notifications stay at count 0. Other Menu rows match `menu-open`.

![21.gifts welcome menu inbox unread](images/welcome-menu-inbox-unread.png)

### Variant: menu-moderation-unread

Staff (moderator) Open **Menu** with `GET /conversations/moderator-group` stubbed unread true → Moderation shows **1** on the right (`nav.moderateUnread`, accessible name Moderation, 1 unread). Notifications and Messages stay at count 0. **Statistics** is already on the member menu (no unread count, immediately after Trust Chain). The only staff extra versus `menu-open` is **Moderation**.

![21.gifts welcome menu moderation unread](images/welcome-menu-moderation-unread.png)

### Variant: menu-staff

Staff (moderator) in a standalone display, so **Install app** is absent. Open **Menu**. Rows: **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, **Profile**, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Moderation** with no unread count, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, **Log out**, then **Version dev**.

![21.gifts welcome menu staff](images/welcome-menu-staff.png)

### Variant: pay-composer

Empty forum, basis account posts **Hello gifts**. The 1-sat compose invoice stays on the composer (`payHost` `'composer'`), not on a listed note. Desktop shows the Bitcoin payment QR and **Pay with Wallet of Satoshi**. A smartphone shows the same invoice card without a mounted `QrCode`; the wallet button remains. The empty-feed copy stays visible.

![21.gifts welcome pay composer](images/welcome-pay-composer.png)

### Variant: pay-amount

Payable reply after **Show reactions**, Gift opened, amount filled, not submitted. Amount CTA is **Continue** (`forum.payContinue`) on every user-agent. Live equivalent in the preferred fiat (no picker). No error, no payment QR, no wallet **Pay** button yet. The post itself does not show Send Bitcoin.

![21.gifts welcome pay amount](images/welcome-pay-amount.png)

### Variant: pay-qr

Payable reply, Gift amount submitted. Captured at desktop and mobile. On desktop the invoice card shows the Bitcoin payment QR, a Close (`X`) control, not Back, and a **Pay** button with the Wallet of Satoshi icon. On a smartphone the same invoice card is shown, without a mounted `QrCode`; the wallet **Pay** button remains, with **Waiting for payment…** under it and a Close (`X`) control, not Back. The invoice step shows the sat amount and the default fiat from the latest gift-day rate.

![21.gifts welcome pay QR](images/welcome-pay-qr.png)

### Variant: pay-smartphone

Same pay sheet captured at desktop and mobile. On a smartphone user-agent: the same invoice card is shown without a mounted `QrCode`; the **Pay** button with the Wallet of Satoshi icon remains, with **Waiting for payment…** under it and a Close (`X`) control, not Back. The invoice step shows the sat amount and the default fiat from the latest gift-day rate. On desktop this scenario shows the QR invoice card.

![21.gifts welcome pay smartphone](images/welcome-pay-smartphone.png)

### Variant: pay-author-wallet

Payable reply, Gift amount submitted, but the author's wallet cannot mint a zap invoice. The pay sheet stays on the amount form and shows **The author's wallet cannot receive this Bitcoin payment**. Amount CTA is **Continue** (`forum.payContinue`) on every user-agent. No payment QR and no invoice-step **Pay with Wallet of Satoshi** button.

![21.gifts welcome pay author wallet](images/welcome-pay-author-wallet.png)

### Variant: pay-deleted

Payable reply, Gift amount submitted, but the note was deleted. The pay sheet stays on the amount form and shows **This note was deleted.**, with no payment QR and no invoice-step Pay button.

![21.gifts welcome pay deleted](images/welcome-pay-deleted.png)

### Variant: role-hint

Carol's **Verified** tag clicked; the explanation under that card header is visible (**A moderator has met this person in real life and confirmed they are real.**). Bob stays without a pill; Ada still shows **Moderator**.

![21.gifts welcome role hint](images/welcome-role-hint.png)

### Variant: overlay-address

Named member with living-room rules agreed and no Wallet of Satoshi address. Composer filled, **Post** clicked. `RequirementsOverlay` dialog **Add your Wallet of Satoshi address** with the profile Lightning Address field (`LightningAddressForm variant=profile`). No **Skip**. Close (X) is present.

![21.gifts welcome overlay address](images/welcome-overlay-address.png)

### Variant: overlay-username

Named member with living-room rules agreed and no username. Composer filled, **Post** clicked. `RequirementsOverlay` dialog **Add your 21.gifts name** with `UsernameForm variant=overlay`. No **Skip**. Close (X) is present.

![21.gifts welcome overlay username](images/welcome-overlay-username.png)

### Variant: overlay-introduce

Named member with living-room rules agreed, a Wallet of Satoshi address, and `hasPosted` false. After login on `/welcome`, `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` dialog **Introduce yourself** with body copy and **Write an introduction**. Close (X) is icon-only.

- **Actions:** Close dismisses this mount only. **Write an introduction** (`Button` `type="button"` `size="lg"`) dismisses the overlay, focuses the welcome composer (`requestForumCompose` / `FORUM_COMPOSE_EVENT`), and `router.push('/welcome')` only when the path is not already `/welcome`.

![21.gifts welcome overlay introduce](images/welcome-overlay-introduce.png)

### Variant: overlay-external-link

Named member with living-room rules dismissed and a paid forum note whose body is `New:` plus `https://example.com/phish`. Clicking that URL opens `ExternalLinkWarning` dialog **Open external link?** with the catalog body, the destination URL as `break-all` text, labeled **Open link**, and icon-only Close. Internal 21.gifts URLs on the same board do not open this overlay.

- **Actions:** Close dismisses without opening. **Open link** (`Button` `type="button"` `size="lg"`) confirms and hands the https URL to `openInSystemBrowser`.

![21.gifts welcome overlay external link](images/welcome-overlay-external-link.png)

### Variant: shop-tag

Ada's paid note includes `#21GiftsShop`. The card shows a `#Shop` pill linking to `/shops` and the visible body hides the raw hashtag. Other welcome chrome matches default.

![21.gifts welcome shop-tag](images/welcome-shop-tag.png)

### Variant: shop-edit

A moderator session. One top-level shop note **Cafe Luna**. The footer shows **Edit shop note** after copy. The editor is closed.

![21.gifts welcome shop edit](images/welcome-shop-edit.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-open

A moderator clicked **Edit shop note** on Cafe Luna. Step **1 / 5 · Photos** is open and **History** says there are no edits yet. The photo step dismisses with an icon-only Close (X). Its accessible name is Cancel. There is no visible Cancel word.

![21.gifts welcome shop edit open](images/welcome-shop-edit-open.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-place

The same moderator pressed **Next**. Step **2 / 5 · Place** is open. **History** still says there are no edits yet. The photo step's Close (X) is gone. The top-left arrow returns to the photo step.

![21.gifts welcome shop edit place](images/welcome-shop-edit-place.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-text

**Next** again. Step **3 / 5 · Text** is open. The shop text is already filled.

![21.gifts welcome shop edit text](images/welcome-shop-edit-text.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-user

**Next** again. Step **4 / 5 · 21.gifts user** is open. The username is empty. **History** still says there are no edits yet.

![21.gifts welcome shop edit user](images/welcome-shop-edit-user.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-summary

**Next** again. Step **5 / 5 · Summary** is open. The card lists Photos **None**, Place **None**, Text **Cafe Luna**, and 21.gifts user **None**.

![21.gifts welcome shop edit summary](images/welcome-shop-edit-summary.png)

## Screen: /shops

- **URL:** `/shops` — signed-in shop listings. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome` (`OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`). There is no `route.ts` beside this page.
- **What the user sees:** Flow `AppShell` (`align="start"`) with one top-left arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`; previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) and wordmark → `/welcome` top-left and one **Menu** top-right; open it for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**. Heading **Shops**, lead **Add a shop with photos, a place, text, and an optional 21.gifts user. It appears here and in the forum with a #Shop tag.** Under the lead a pill offers **Post**, **Map**, and **Table**. **Post** is selected and is the list below. `/shops#map` opens **Map** and `/shops#table` opens **Table**. `/shops#post`, no hash, or an unknown hash opens **Post**. Choosing an option writes that hash; **Post** clears it. **Map** is the place list, without a second Map heading. An old `/map` address opens this option and keeps `?pin=`. With a map key, several pins and no matching `?pin=` frame every pin. One pin, or a matching `?pin=`, stays centered on that pin. **Table** has columns **Name**, **Place**, and **Operator**. **Show more** loads the next page. A page with no shop rows still shows **Show more** when another page exists, and does not say there are no shops. If the next page fails, the rows stay and **Try again** reloads it. **Map** can also be empty, loading, or in error, using the place-map copy, still without a second Map heading. There is no Active / No gifts yet / All / Most popular control. On **Post**, a closed **Add a shop** button sits under the pill. It opens five steps: photos, place, text, an optional 21.gifts user, then a summary whose **Post** sends the note. The text step lists people as soon as `@` is typed. There is no **Ask for money** pill. A moderator also sees **Edit shop note** on each shop card, and on a shop pin in **Map** and beside the name in **Table**. The list is every top-level note from `GET /messages?hashtag=21GiftsShop&mode=all` (app proxy `/forum/messages`), newest first, including notes with zero sats. The composer does not show the hashtag; submit appends `#21GiftsShop`. The living-room laws hint is absent. Shop cards show a `#Shop` pill (link `/shops`) and hide the raw token. A moderator footer has **Add an account** beside **Add a place**. A saved account is an `@username` link to `/members/{id}` under the text. When that page is empty, empty copy **No shops yet — add the first one.** immediately. Loading copy: **Loading…**. Error copy plus **Try again**.
- **Actions:** Post a shop (text and/or photo or video) and attach or remove an optional place. Expand a note, open Menu including **Shops**. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. From the place step of **Add a shop** or **Edit shop note**, that same arrow returns to the previous step and is disabled while the note is sending. The form has no **Back** button. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `ShopsScreen`, `ShopsViewSwitch`, `ForumLoader`, `ForumBoard`, `PlacesMapScreen`, `ShopTable`.

### Variant: default

## Screen: /rules

- **URL:** `/rules` — public living-room rules. App chrome (semantic tokens; not the dark marketing shell). No auth gate to view; chrome depends on hydrated session.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (wordmark + menu/language inside the rounded sheet). Page heading **Living room rules**, then the lead paragraph with the accent-bordered **The test** callout, three rule cards (kicker **Rule n**, title, body, and a **The test** callout on rules 1 and 2), the Welcome / Allowed / Better not / Forbidden lists as bordered cards with check / minus / cross glyphs (Forbidden has three subheads), the muted **Our house** closing block, and one CTA **Contact 21.gifts** (`/contact`). There is no second back in the document. Unsigned (no session): one top-left arrow that returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none, wordmark → `/` (the wordmark is not that control), LanguageSwitcher. Hydrated session: `ProfileChromeLeft` (the same arrow; wordmark → `/welcome`) + `SignedInChrome` (Menu with **Home** first). Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false.
- **Actions:** Change language (unsigned), or open **Menu** (signed-in). The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. Read the rules. Open contact. There is no second forum CTA. Dismiss `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` for this mount (Close) or **Write an introduction** (dismisses, focuses the welcome composer via `requestForumCompose` / `FORUM_COMPOSE_EVENT`; `router.push('/welcome')` only when the path is not already `/welcome`).
- **Calls:** `RulesPageChrome`, `PageChrome`, `AppShell`, `Wordmark`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `SignedInChrome`, `IntroduceYourselfOverlay`, `RulesPage`, `RulesDocument`, `LanguageSwitcher`.
- **Auth:** None required to view; chrome depends on hydrated session.

### Variant: default

Full rules body with rule card **Only free donations** visible.

![21.gifts living room rules](images/rules.png)

### Variant: signed-in

Hydrated Ada session: one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) + wordmark → `/welcome`. The wordmark is not that control. **Menu** top-right (**Home** first). Rule card **Only free donations** still visible.

![21.gifts living room rules signed in](images/rules-signed-in.png)

## Screen: /habit-tracker

- **URL:** `/habit-tracker` — public habit tracker. Every member's habits, periods, and comments. Signed-out visitors can read it. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` with `allowGuest`. HTML `/habit-tracker` is the page, not a GET proxy (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page). JSON is `GET /habits` and `POST /habits`.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` and either **Log in** or Menu, inside the rounded sheet). The page is a server component; `HabitTrackerTopRight` is the client boundary for that corner. Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`). Heading **Habit-Tracker**. The schedule line says each habit is daily or weekly in the time zone chosen when it was created, a week can be rated from Monday 08:00 in that zone. People are grouped under their `ownerName`. Each habit is the same note card as a living-room note: name, a Daily or Weekly chip, an Archived chip when it has a last period, the public description when one is set, and one row per period (the date, then Achieved, Partially achieved, Not achieved, or Not rated yet). Comments are public and are not forum posts. Internal notes render only for the owner (`Internal notes:` plus the text). A signed-out visitor uses the header **Log in** and gets no second sign-in link, no add form, no rating pill, and no **Send Bitcoin**. A session sees an add form (Name, Description, Internal notes, a Daily | Weekly pill, **Add habit**). On each of their open habits every returned period is that same pill (Achieved, Partially achieved, Not achieved; nothing pressed when that period is not rated yet). A saved rating leaves that choice pressed. An archived habit keeps those period rows, its comments, and **Send Bitcoin** on someone else's comment, and shows the Archived chip, with no rating pill, Edit, or Archive. **Edit** opens Name, Description, and Internal notes. **Save** and **Cancel** are icons; their accessible names are Save and Cancel, and the word Save is not visible. **Archive** opens the same inline confirm as deleting a note: the sentence, then a check named Confirm archive and an X named Cancel archive. A signed-in account sees **Write a comment** and **Post** on each habit. On the device's local Sunday those controls and **Delete comment** are removed and **Writing is paused on Sunday.** stands in their place. Add, the rating pill, Edit, and Archive stay on Sunday. **Send Bitcoin** (the same Gift control as a forum reply) is on someone else's comment and opens the same amount sheet. On Sunday that gift shows **Zapping is paused on Sunday.** Menu row **Habit-Tracker** (`nav.habitTracker`, lucide `ListChecks`, `/habit-tracker`) sits immediately after **Living room rules** for every signed-in account.
- **Actions:** Read the list. Sign in. Add a habit. Edit name, description, and internal notes. Rate any returned period on an open habit Achieved, Partially achieved, or Not achieved. An archived habit stays read-only for rating, edit, and archive, and keeps its comments and gift. Archive after confirm. A failed save keeps the list and shows **Could not load or save the tracker. Please try again.** with **Try again** above it. A failed edit keeps that form open under the alert. A failed archive keeps the confirmation open under the alert. A failed add keeps the entered form under the alert. A failed comment keeps that draft under the alert. Saving a new habit, saving an edit, posting a comment, and confirming a comment deletion each leave their own result. An initiator sees **Delete comment** before that confirm. **Try again** reloads and does not send that same action again. A different session may send it. **Try again**, and a later load after the session changes, keep that list when the next `GET /habits` also fails. The full-screen error is only when nothing has loaded. Add, comment, delete, and the invoice send `Time-Zone`. Edit, log, and archive do not. Post a comment. Delete a comment when the account is at least initiator, after the same inline confirm. The check is named Confirm deletion and the X is named Cancel deletion. On the device's local Sunday comment, delete, and the gift are paused. Add, rating, Edit, and Archive are not. Open **Send Bitcoin**, enter an amount, press **Continue**, and pay from the same invoice card as a forum reply. **Continue** stays disabled until the gift-day rate request has settled. **Continue** stays disabled and shows a spinner while the invoice request is in flight. A settled request with no usable rate still allows **Continue**, and the fiat line stays absent. An amount that is not a whole number of sats from 1 through 10,000,000 shows `Expected a JSON body with an integer "amountSats"` and does not open the invoice. A payment that cannot be started shows **Could not start the Bitcoin payment**. Too many payments shows **Too many payments. Please wait a moment and try again.** A wallet that cannot receive the payment shows **The author's wallet cannot receive this Bitcoin payment**. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `HabitTrackerTopRight`, `HabitTrackerPage`, `MemberHabits`, `HabitComments`, `ForumPaySheet`, `useLatestRateDayState`, `SundayWritingGate`, `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `fetchMemberHabits`, `postMemberHabit`.
- **Auth:** No bearer required to read the page or `GET /habits`. `POST /habits` needs a bearer. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` with `allowGuest`. The page does not pay an invoice.

## Screen: /contact

- **URL:** `/contact` — signed-in in-app contact (the only way to reach 21.gifts). Same onboarding gate as `/welcome` (`account.setup` null; name and address may be skipped; living-room rules agreement required).
- **What the user sees:** Fill `AppShell` with one top-left arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`; previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) and wordmark → `/welcome` top-left and one **Menu** top-right; open it for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**. Heading **Contact**, lead **Write to 21.gifts here — there is no email address. This is the only way to reach us.**, link to **Living room rules**, composer textarea with an icon-only **Send** control (`contact.send` catalog `aria-label`, no visible Send text). A missing name, username, or rules agreement opens `RequirementsOverlay` (no Skip) before the send retries. Lightning Address is not required for contact. A successful send opens the official 21.gifts thread in `/messages`. Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false.
- **Actions:** Send a message, complete a `RequirementsOverlay` for a missing name, username, or rules agreement, open the rules; the top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**; dismiss `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` for this mount or follow **Write an introduction** to `/welcome`.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `ContactPage`, `ContactLoader`, `ContactScreen`, `RequirementsOverlay`, `SignedInChrome`, `IntroduceYourselfOverlay`, `OnboardingGate`, `postContact` (`POST /contact/submit`), `fetchConversations`.
- **Auth:** Bearer session; `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`.

### Variant: default

Idle composer with lead and rules link.

![21.gifts contact](images/contact.png)

### Variant: validation-error

Click **Send** with an empty composer → **Enter a message**.

![21.gifts contact validation error](images/contact-validation-error.png)

### Variant: success

After a successful send the app navigates to `/messages?c=` and shows the official **21.gifts** thread (the message body, not a dead-end thank-you sentence). Composer with ImagePlus attach visible. The message and send share one row; the amount sits under the message.

![21.gifts contact success](images/contact-success.png)

## Screen: /members/[accountId]

- **Purpose:** Signed-in member identity card (chart, About me inside the card — not a forum post, name, location, public `username@21.gifts`, role pill, copy-profile-link, and clickable post/reply counts from `postCount` / `replyCount`) with on-demand activity feeds below the card. A successful empty series and in-flight activity show `profile.chartEmpty` (**No gifts yet.**); a thrown activity load shows `profile.chartError` (**Could not load gifts.**); the chart never says **Loading…** and has no retry control. Location is read-only. Own profiles use this route too (forum author names navigate here, not `/profile`). When the viewer is a moderator and the subject is someone else, staff Trust Chain actions (Verify, Propose, Confirm, or Appoint) and the already-on-chain link sit behind the closed **Moderator functions** disclosure, not always visible. About me is not a `ForumBoard` post; **Translate** (Languages icon) sits on the About me text when `profileMessage.id` is set, and in the footer icon row with react / copy on feed notes and replies via `TranslatableNoteBody` (`controlSlotId`), which portals `NoteTranslate`, when the language differs from the UI locale. The in-card reply composer includes an **Amount** sats field; empty text and an empty amount invoices 21 sats; a reply with text and an empty amount is unpaid for a verified member, otherwise 1 sat to 21.gifts on the composer slot (`payHost: composer`, `payMessageId` = compose-target note); extra gifts and Gift-open stay on the card (`payHost: card`); an amount of 0 is billed as 1 sat. Visible inline photos on the posts feed and replies feed (the stacked activity list) load via `fetchMessagePhoto` blob URLs, same as the home forum top-level cards. Top-level posts with a positive `goalSats` show `ForumGoalBar` (orange through 100%, in-flow green overflow, uncapped percent), same as `/welcome`. Blob URLs may also be fetched for expanded thread replies, but ForumBoard does not paint photos on nested replies. A missing name, Lightning Address, or rules agreement on a reply opens `RequirementsOverlay` (no Skip). Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false. When a username is set, a centered `QrCode` (label `profile.giftsQr`) under the address encodes `openCryptoPayQrValue` (`https://<domain>/pl/?lightning=` plus the uppercase LNURL of `https://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<local>`), including on a smartphone. A missing username shows no QR. Under that QR a labeled **Shop sticker** button (`profile.shopSticker`, `Button size="sm" variant="secondary"`) opens `ShopStickerOverlay`: a preview of a printable shop-window sticker carrying the same `openCryptoPayQrValue`, and a download as PDF (vector, 134.4 mm), PNG or JPG (3000 px), or SVG. The files are made in the browser (`shopStickerBlob`); nothing is sent to the api.
- **Inputs:** Bearer session; `accountId` UUID; `GET /forum/members/:id` for the profile and activity counts; `GET /forum/members/:id/activity` even if the Lightning Address is blank; `GET /gifts/stats` for the gift-day rate when a feed amount or ask has no stored string for the visitor's currency, and for unsent previews (a stored string is shown as-is; no FiatPicker on the chart or the feed — member profiles are always signed-in); on-demand `GET /forum/members/:id/posts` or `GET /forum/members/:id/replies` for the selected feed.
- **Actions:** Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**, then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`); the top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; expand role hint; copy the profile link (`profile.copyLink` **Copy link to this profile** → origin `/l/` plus the first 8 hex chars of the account id); Message on the card when another member has a `profileMessage`; translate a foreign-language About me text when `profileMessage.id` is set, and a foreign-language feed note or reply (**Translate**, Languages icon, / Show original / Show translation); click **1 post** or **N posts** (`profile.postCount`) or **1 reaction** or **N reactions** (`profile.replyCount`) to open that `ForumBoard` feed below the card, or click the pressed count again to collapse it. Posts show React and do not show Send Bitcoin; a payable reply card in the replies feed shows Gift. Expanding a reply with a `parentId` navigates to `/messages/{parentId}`. Verified members may post unpaid replies; below verified a text reply invoices 1 sat to 21.gifts on the composer slot (`payHost: composer`, `payMessageId` = compose-target note); extra gifts and Gift-open stay on the card (`payHost: card`). When a listed feed is shorter than its count, a muted `profile.activityLatest` truncation line shows the displayed and total counts. Inline photos load via `fetchMessagePhoto` blob URLs, same as the forum. Complete a `RequirementsOverlay` for a missing name, Lightning Address, or rules agreement before a reply; dismiss `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` for this mount (Close) or **Write an introduction** (dismisses, focuses the welcome composer via `requestForumCompose` / `FORUM_COMPOSE_EVENT`; `router.push('/welcome')` only when the path is not already `/welcome`). Staff viewing another member can open **Verify** (`/members/[accountId]/verify`; it does not post from the card), Propose, Confirm, or Appoint after opening the closed **Moderator functions** disclosure; already-on-chain is a link behind the same disclosure. When a username is set, press **Shop sticker**, pick PDF, PNG, JPG, or SVG, and **Download** the file `21gifts-shop-sticker-<username>.<format>`; a failure shows an alert and the next try clears it. The identity card has no edit. A moderator sees **Edit shop note** on a shop post in the posts feed.
- **Used by:** Route `/members/[accountId]` (`MemberProfilePage` / `MemberProfileLoader` / `MemberProfileScreen`).
- **Auth:** Bearer; `OnboardingGate screen="profile"`.

### Variant: default

Member identity card with About me inside the card when `aboutMe` is set; read-only location; Message on the card when another member has a `profileMessage`. Not a forum post. A successful empty series and in-flight activity show `profile.chartEmpty` (**No gifts yet.**); a thrown activity load shows `profile.chartError` (**Could not load gifts.**); the chart never says **Loading…** and has no retry control.

![21.gifts member profile](images/members.png)

### Variant: software-developer

Basis member identity card. Beside the name, a static Software Developer label (a span, not a button and not a role). There is no role pill. About me and Message stay as on the default member card.

### Variant: posts-open-goal-110

Identity card; posts pressed; profile note hidden; the listed post has `sats: 23100` and `goalSats: 21000`. The ask is defined in bitcoin, so `ForumGoalBar` names **Ask ₿21'000 · $21.00** and the note amount is **₿23'100 · $23.10** (viewer USD from the gift-day rate). Full orange plus in-flow green overflow and label **110%**, same as `/welcome` `goal-110`.

![21.gifts member posts open with 110 percent goal](images/members-posts-open-goal-110.png)

### Variant: posts-open-goal-fiat

Identity card; posts pressed; the listed English post is defined as **$1.50** with frozen **₿1'000** and label **0%**. No second dollar amount. The note matches the UI language, so the card does not offer Translate. The received amount is **₿0 · $0.00**.

![21.gifts member posts open with fiat goal](images/members-posts-open-goal-fiat.png)

### Variant: posts-open-goal-credit

Identity card; posts pressed; the listed post has `sats: 10500`, `goalSats: 21000`, `goalRepayable: true`, and `goalTermDays: 30`. The ask is defined in bitcoin, so the bar shows **Ask ₿21'000 · $21.00**, the note amount **₿10'500 · $10.50**, a **Loan** tag and **To repay per day: ₿700 · $0.70 per day for 30 days.** Label **50%**. The post offers **Repayment list**, a link to /messages/<id>/repayment-list. The day list is not on this card.

![21.gifts member posts open with credit goal](images/members-posts-open-goal-credit.png)

### Variant: posts-open-loan-tag-open

Same post as **posts-open-goal-credit**, after **Loan** is pressed. A line under the name says a loan is paid back.

### Variant: posts-open-donation-tag-open

Same post as **posts-open-goal-110**, after **Donation** is pressed. A line under the name says a donation is a gift and is not paid back.

### Variant: sticker-kikamba

![21.gifts member shop edit summary](images/members-shop-edit-summary.png)

## Screen: /members/[accountId]/verify

- **Purpose:** The stored-name check only. Heading **Verify**. A moderator who is not the subject, and a basis member with a stored name that is not only whitespace, sees that name as an underlined link to the member card, the question under it, then **Yes** and **No**. A blank name shows the missing sentence and neither button. A signed-in viewer who cannot verify sees **You cannot verify this member.** Loading is **Loading…**. A failed load is the profile error plus **Try again**. An unknown id or a missing member is **This profile could not be found.** A failed verify stays on the page with **Could not update this member. Please try again.** **Yes** and **No** remain. On the device-local Sunday the question and the name stay, **Writing is paused on Sunday.** is shown, and neither button is visible. No in-card back. No Cancel. Chrome back does not post. No route.ts beside the page.
- **Actions:** **Yes** posts the untrimmed stored name and then opens `/members/[accountId]`. While that post is in flight, **Yes** shows a spinner and both buttons are disabled. **No** opens `/members/[accountId]` and does not post. **Try again** repeats a failed load. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. There is no Cancel control.
- **Used by:** route `/members/[accountId]/verify` (`MemberVerifyPage` / `MemberVerifyScreen`). The **Verify** link on `/members/[accountId]` is shown only to a moderator viewing another basis member, inside **Moderator functions**.

### Variant: default

Stored name **Ada** as a link, the question, **Yes** and **No**.

![21.gifts member verify](images/members-verify.png)

### Variant: unnamed

Basis member with no stored name. **Verification needs a stored name that identifies this person.** Neither **Yes** nor **No**.

![21.gifts member verify unnamed](images/members-verify-unnamed.png)

### Variant: loading

Heading **Verify** and **Loading…** while the member fetch has not settled.

![21.gifts member verify loading](images/members-verify-loading.png)

### Variant: error

Member fetch failed. **Could not load this profile. Please try again.** and **Try again**.

![21.gifts member verify error](images/members-verify-error.png)

### Variant: missing

Unknown id or a missing member. **This profile could not be found.**

![21.gifts member verify missing](images/members-verify-missing.png)

### Variant: forbidden

Signed-in viewer who cannot verify. **You cannot verify this member.** The question is absent.

![21.gifts member verify forbidden](images/members-verify-forbidden.png)

### Variant: sunday

Device-local Sunday. The question and **Ada** stay. **Writing is paused on Sunday.** Neither button is visible.

![21.gifts member verify sunday](images/members-verify-sunday.png)

### Variant: failed

The write failed. **Could not update this member. Please try again.** **Yes** and **No** remain.

![21.gifts member verify failed](images/members-verify-failed.png)

### Variant: deciding

Verify POST in flight. **Yes** disabled with a spinner; **No** disabled. The name **Ada** and the question stay.

![21.gifts member verify deciding](images/members-verify-deciding.png)

## Screen: /pos

- **Purpose:** Signed-in point of sale. With no charge, this page is only the Open CryptoPay QR and **Set an amount**. The keypad is `/pos/amount`. Confirming there returns here. The button is then **Cancel**, with the countdown and the amount in bitcoin and fiat. The saved unit is `account.amountUnit`. What is charged is still whole sats. For five minutes `GET /.well-known/lnurlp/:username` pins min and max to that amount. Cancel or expiry clears the pin. The page keeps the open charge and Cancel until the server returns none. No paid status, because Wallet of Satoshi settles the invoice. Missing username or lightning address links to `/profile`.
- **Layout:** `AppShell` fill with profile chrome. `Card` `surface={false}`: heading, centered truncated address, Open CryptoPay QR, content-width **Set an amount** when no charge is open, otherwise the open charge (countdown, including 0:00, bitcoin, default fiat when a gift-day rate exists, and **Cancel**). No keypad on this page.
- **Actions:** **Set an amount** opens `/pos/amount`. **Cancel** clears the charge. Menu row `pos.nav`.
- **Auth:** Bearer session via `OnboardingGate screen="profile"`.
- **Used by:** Route `/pos`.

### Variant: default

Signed-in Ada with a username and Wallet of Satoshi address, no open charge. Heading **Point of sale**, address `alice@21.gifts`, Open CryptoPay QR, and **Set an amount**. No keypad. Desktop, iPad, and smartphone all show the QR.

![21.gifts point of sale](images/pos.png)

### Variant: open

Signed-in Ada with a pending charge of ₿21 and 5:00 left. Countdown, the sat amount, the default fiat under it, and **Cancel** stay up. The amount form is gone. Desktop, iPad, and smartphone all show the Open CryptoPay QR.

![21.gifts point of sale open](images/pos-open.png)

### Variant: loading

The till request has not returned. Heading **Point of sale**, the address, and the spinner. No **Set an amount** yet.

![21.gifts point of sale loading](images/pos-loading.png)

### Variant: error

The till request failed. Alert **Point of sale is unavailable.**

![21.gifts point of sale error](images/pos-error.png)

### Variant: cancel-failed

Open charge of ₿21 with 5:00 left and the default fiat under the sat amount. **Cancel** fails. The charge and **Cancel** stay. Alert **Point of sale is unavailable.**

![21.gifts point of sale cancel failed](images/pos-cancel-failed.png)

### Variant: refresh-failed

The open charge has already run out (0:00). The sat amount and the default fiat stay. Refreshing it fails. **Cancel** stays. Alert **Point of sale is unavailable.**

![21.gifts point of sale refresh failed](images/pos-refresh-failed.png)

### Variant: need-username

Setup is finished and the username is empty. Link **Set a username first.** No address and no amount form.

![21.gifts point of sale need username](images/pos-need-username.png)

### Variant: need-address

Username set, no Wallet of Satoshi address. Link **Set a Wallet of Satoshi address first.** No amount form.

![21.gifts point of sale need address](images/pos-need-address.png)

## Screen: /pos/amount

- **Purpose:** Choose the sat amount for the till. No QR, no address, and no other till action. Confirming creates the charge and returns to `/pos`, which then shows **Cancel**, the countdown, and the amount in bitcoin and fiat. A positive fiat amount while the gift-day request is still loading shows **The {code} exchange rate is still loading.** When the request then settles, that loading alert changes in place without another press and without creating the payment: **No {code} exchange rate yet.** when the currency still cannot be priced, **Enter a whole number.** when the amount is not a safe sat count inside the bounds that button already uses, and the alert goes away when it is. After that request settles, a positive fiat amount when no gift day can price that currency shows **No {code} exchange rate yet.** `{code}` is CHF, EUR, USD, or PHP. An empty bitcoin amount still shows **Enter a whole number.**
- **Layout:** `AppShell` fill. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. It does not jump to `/pos`. `Card` `surface={false}`: heading **Amount**. While the till request is out, a spinner and no keypad. If that request fails, the alert, **Try again**, and no keypad. Otherwise the keypad and **Create payment**. Bitcoin has no decimal key. Fiat shows the number-format decimal (dot for Swiss and US, comma for German; no cookie means Swiss) and keeps two fraction digits. A member who cannot charge, or who already has an open charge, is sent back to `/pos`.
- **Actions:** **Create payment**. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none.
- **Auth:** Bearer session via `OnboardingGate screen="profile"`.
- **Used by:** Route `/pos/amount`.

### Variant: default

Signed-in Ada, no open charge. Heading **Amount**, the unit switch, the keypad, and **Create payment**. The heading is the only **Amount**. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale amount](images/pos-amount.png)

### Variant: loading

The till request has not returned. Heading **Amount** and the spinner. No keypad and no QR.

![21.gifts point of sale amount loading](images/pos-amount-loading.png)

### Variant: error

The till request failed. Heading **Amount**. Alert **Point of sale is unavailable.** **Try again** loads the till once more. No keypad and no QR.

![21.gifts point of sale amount error](images/pos-amount-error.png)

### Variant: bad-amount

**Create payment** while the amount is still empty. Alert **Enter a whole number.** The keypad stays and has no decimal key. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale bad amount](images/pos-bad-amount.png)

### Variant: rate-loading

PHP is pressed and the amount is 100. **Create payment** while the gift-day request has not returned. Alert **The PHP exchange rate is still loading.** The keypad stays. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale rate loading](images/pos-rate-loading.png)

### Variant: no-rate

PHP is pressed and the amount is 100. The gift-day request has settled and no day can price PHP. **Create payment** shows **No PHP exchange rate yet.** The keypad stays. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale no rate](images/pos-no-rate.png)

### Variant: create-outside

**Create payment** with `21`. The till answers that the amount is outside the wallet. Alert **Amount is outside the wallet range.** The keypad stays. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale create outside](images/pos-create-outside.png)

### Variant: create-already

**Create payment** with `21`. The till answers that a payment is already open. Alert **A payment is already open.** The keypad stays. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale create already](images/pos-create-already.png)

### Variant: create-failed

**Create payment** with `21`. The till does not answer. Alert **Point of sale is unavailable.** The keypad stays. No QR.

![21.gifts point of sale create failed](images/pos-create-failed.png)

## Screen: /profile

- **Purpose:** Signed-in profile after onboarding: compact dual-line Given/Received activity chart (no chart FiatPicker; populated ₿ | selected fiat `SegmentedControl tone="gift"`) inside the identity card, a resting header when a profile photo or wide image is stored (round photo and wide image are different pictures, and neither is the About me photo; a missing wide image or profile photo is the button **Add a wide image** or **Add a profile photo**), About me inside the same card (not a forum post; Languages **Translate** on the filled read-only text when `aboutMessageId` is set; owner empty prompt + **Write your About me** when `aboutMe` is null and `aboutMeHasPhoto` is false; filled text and/or photo otherwise, with attach, preview, and remove in the editor), copy-profile-link on the card, edit name and location (Ort), then the same public facts a visitor sees on `/members/:id` (role pill, funding-program icon, `username@21.gifts`, pay QR, Shop sticker, Posts/Reactions counts, and the activity feed; no Message button and no staff actions), then edit the Wallet of Satoshi address, then Notifications pills (All / Active / Mentions `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"`) and, when Push APIs are ready, a second This device On / Off `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` (incoming pushes always show an OS banner, including when a 21.gifts tab is focused), choose language (uppercase kicker, one-row `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` same as Theme, endonyms English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino), then appearance (System / Light / Dark), then preferred fiat (`FiatPreferenceSwitcher`, the only signed-in FiatPicker, same pill chrome as Theme, not the compact orange gift picker), then number format (`NumberFormatSwitcher`, uppercase kicker, `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"`, samples `10'000.23` / `10,000.23` / `23.000,33`) as the last identity-card settings row. Chrome is the page-frame header (icon-only back + wordmark + Menu inside the rounded sheet). Menu starts with **Home**; the Profile row shows no given or received amounts. Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false.
- **Inputs:** Session account (name + location + Lightning Address + `viewKey` + `aboutMe` + `aboutMeHasPhoto` + living-room rules agreement + optional `notificationLevel`) via `OnboardingGate` / `useAuthStore`; Given + Received from `GET /me/activity` via `useAccountTotals` / `fetchAccountActivity`. Fetch even with a blank Lightning Address. About me save is `PUT /me/about` (`putAboutMe`). The profile photo is `GET`/`PUT` `/pictures/me`. The wide image is `GET`/`PUT` `/banners/me`. Neither slot is filled from the About me photo. Location save is `POST /me/location` (`setLocation`). Notification level save is `POST /me/notification-level` (`postNotificationLevel`).
- **Actions:** Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile (current), **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out** (best-effort Web Push unsubscribe while the session is still valid), then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`); the top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; write or edit About me, and from that editor attach or remove each of the three pictures (About me photo, profile photo, and wide image); copy the profile link (`profile.copyLink` **Copy link to this profile** → origin `/view/<viewKey>`, URL/key not shown); save name; save or clear location; link or change address; choose All / Active / Mentions on the Notifications `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` under the address form, and when Push APIs are ready choose On / Off on a second This device `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` (`aria.push`); choose language on the Language settings row after notifications (`LanguagePreferenceSwitcher`, uppercase kicker, one-row `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` same as Theme, endonyms English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino); choose System / Light / Dark (`ThemeSwitcher`, `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"`); choose preferred fiat on the Fiat currency settings row (`FiatPreferenceSwitcher`, same pill chrome as Theme, not the compact orange gift picker — the only signed-in control that writes the `fiat` cookie); choose number format on the last identity-card settings row (`NumberFormatSwitcher`, uppercase kicker, `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"`, samples `10'000.23` / `10,000.23` / `23.000,33`); when the series has data, toggle the activity chart between ₿ and the selected fiat. On iPhone Safari outside standalone, a short install hint (`profile.push.installHint`) appears under the This device pill; dismiss `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` for this mount (Close) or **Write an introduction** (dismisses, focuses the welcome composer via `requestForumCompose` / `FORUM_COMPOSE_EVENT`; `router.push('/welcome')` only when the path is not already `/welcome`).
- **Used by:** Route `/profile` (`ProfilePage`).

### Variant: default

Above the heading, **Add a wide image** and **Add a profile photo** when those pictures are not stored. Heading **Profile**, then inside the single `max-w-sm` identity card: no chart FiatPicker. When the series is empty, `profile.chartEmpty` (`role="status"`, **No gifts yet.**) with no axis/SVG / no ₿|fiat scale; otherwise a compact Given/Received chart (legend left, ₿ | selected fiat `SegmentedControl tone="gift"` right; no chart title heading); About me with empty prompt **Tell others who you are.** and **Write your About me** when `aboutMe` is null (not a forum post); icon-only **Copy link to this profile**; name, location (**Location** / **Ort**, unset shows **Not set**), then the public member facts (role pill when the role is verified or above, funding-program icon when `fundingReviewedAt` is a number (pressing it reveals that one sentence), `username@21.gifts`, pay QR and **Shop sticker** when a username is set, including on a smartphone, and **Posts** / **Reactions** count buttons that open the same activity feed as `/members/:id`), then Wallet of Satoshi address fields with icon actions to the right (pencil / check / X / trash), then a Notifications section with a three-stage All / Active / Mentions `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` and, when Push APIs are ready, a second This device On / Off `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` (selected fill `bg-app-btn`; On / Off visible text), then a Language settings row (uppercase kicker and one-row `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` same as Theme, English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino), then a Theme settings row (uppercase kicker and `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` System / Light / Dark), then a Fiat currency settings row (`FiatPreferenceSwitcher`, the only FiatPicker on the card, same pill chrome as Theme, not the compact orange gift picker; CHF|EUR|USD|PHP), then a Number format settings row (uppercase kicker and `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` samples `10'000.23` / `10,000.23` / `23.000,33`); no **View key** heading and no visible URL/key text. No second panel below the card. Icon-only back and wordmark in the page-frame header (the arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none); one **Menu** in that same header row (**Home** first; log out, then a quiet **Version {version}** line (`app.version`); the Profile row shows no given or received amounts). Chart never swaps to **Loading…**. A failed activity load is `profile.chartError`.

### Variant: about-photo

Owner card with bio and photo. Seed GET /me with `aboutMe: 'I build on Bitcoin'`, `aboutMeHasPhoto: true`. Stub GET `/me/about/photo` 200 JPEG. Shows the stored image (`About me photo`, the whole picture, `object-contain`, `max-h-80`, not a cover crop), the bio text, and the icon-only pencil (`Edit About me`), not the empty CTA. No stored profile photo and no stored wide image, so the header shows **Add a wide image** and **Add a profile photo**.

![21.gifts profile About me photo](images/profile-about-photo.png)

### Variant: images

Owner card with three different pictures at once. Stub GET `/pictures/me` with a square portrait, GET `/banners/me` with a wide scene, and GET `/me/about/photo` with a third photograph. The wide image is the card header, the profile photo is the round picture on its lower edge, and the About me photo stays under the bio.

![21.gifts profile images](images/profile-images.png)

### Variant: photo-only

![21.gifts profile photo only](images/profile-photo-only.png)

### Variant: banner-only

Wide image only. Stub GET `/banners/me` with the wide scene. No profile photo, so **Add a profile photo** sits under the banner. Needle `state-profile-banner-only`.

![21.gifts profile banner only](images/profile-banner-only.png)

### Variant: banner-not-wide

Choosing a square portrait for the wide image opens the 5:2 cropper (**Drag the photo to choose the wide image**, labeled **Use this crop**, X with accessible name **Cancel crop**). **Add a wide image** is hidden. **Add a profile photo** stays. Needle `state-profile-banner-not-wide`.

![21.gifts profile banner not wide](images/profile-banner-not-wide.png)

### Variant: banner-crop-saving

The wide-image cropper stays open while PUT `/banners/me` has not answered. **Use this crop** is disabled and shows a spinner. **Add a wide image** stays hidden. **Add a profile photo** stays, disabled, without a spinner. Needle `state-profile-banner-crop-saving`.

### Variant: banner-crop-save-error

PUT `/banners/me` answers 500 after **Use this crop**. Alert **Could not save. Please try again.** The cropper stays open (**Drag the photo to choose the wide image**, **Use this crop**, X with accessible name **Cancel crop**). Needle `state-profile-banner-crop-save-error`.

![21.gifts profile banner crop save error](images/profile-banner-crop-save-error.png)

### Variant: banner-crop-too-large

**Use this crop** encodes a JPEG over 1 MB. Alert **Keep photos under 1 MB**. The cropper stays open. Needle `state-profile-banner-crop-too-large`.

![21.gifts profile picture unsupported](images/profile-picture-unsupported.png)

### Variant: picture-too-large

![21.gifts profile picture too large](images/profile-picture-too-large.png)

### Variant: picture-save-error

PUT `/pictures/me` answers 500 after a JPEG is chosen. Alert **Could not save. Please try again.** The profile-photo button stays. Needle `state-profile-picture-save-error`.

![21.gifts profile picture save error](images/profile-picture-save-error.png)

### Variant: picture-saving

The profile-photo button is disabled and shows a spinner while PUT `/pictures/me` has not answered. Needle `state-profile-picture-saving`.

![21.gifts profile picture saving](images/profile-picture-saving.png)

### Variant: images-editing

Owner editor opened from variant **images**. The same three stubs are loaded (square portrait, wide scene, About me photo) and the seed is `aboutMe: 'I build on Bitcoin'` with `aboutMeHasPhoto: true`. **Edit About me** opens the textarea. The editor shows the round profile photo beside **Remove profile photo**, the wide image beside **Remove wide image**, and the About me photo beside **Remove photo**. The three icon-only attaches remain: **Add a photo** (`profile.about.attach`), **Add a profile photo** (`profile.about.portrait`), and **Add a wide image** (`profile.about.banner`). Needle `Remove profile photo`.

![21.gifts profile images editing](images/profile-images-editing.png)

### Variant: about-editing

Owner in the About me textarea editor. From the empty CTA, click **Write your About me** (empty→Write is enough). Needle: `getByRole('textbox', { name: 'About me' })` / **Save About me** icon button. Save/cancel are icon-only IconButtons (`getByRole` + catalog text is not visible). textarea uses `text-base`. The empty editor still shows three icon-only attaches: **Add a photo** (`profile.about.attach`), **Add a profile photo** (`profile.about.portrait`), and **Add a wide image** (`profile.about.banner`). No picture is stored yet, so **Remove profile photo**, **Remove wide image**, and **Remove photo** are absent.

![21.gifts profile About me editing](images/profile-about-editing.png)

### Variant: about-banner-crop

About me editor with the wide-image cropper inside it. From the empty CTA, **Write your About me**, then a square portrait on the editor wide-image input. The cropper sits under the textarea (**Drag the photo to choose the wide image**, **Use this crop**, X with accessible name **Cancel crop**). The header **Add a wide image** stays, because that crop belongs to the header. Needle `state-profile-about-banner-crop`.

![21.gifts profile About me banner crop](images/profile-about-banner-crop.png)

### Variant: about-banner-crop-saving

Same editor cropper while PUT `/banners/me` has not answered. **Use this crop** is disabled and shows a spinner. **Save About me** is disabled and is not the spinning control. Needle `state-profile-about-banner-crop-saving`.

![21.gifts profile push enable error](images/profile-push-enable-error.png)

## Screen: /grants

- **Purpose:** Signed-in grants page. `GrantsScreen` shows `FundingStatusCard`. The only title is the page `h1` **21 gifts grant**. A signed-in account also sees a secondary large **Goals** link to `/grants/goals`, under the grant card and above the staff queue. A missing account shows no link. An initiator or founder also sees two secondary large links, **Daily payment text** to `/grants/payments/comment` and **Daily payment amounts** to `/grants/payments/amounts`. Those links do not load the roster. A moderator does not see them. An account at least moderator (`roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`), including an initiator and a founder, with at least one open application sees a secondary large **Open application (1)** link when the count is one and **Open applications (N)** otherwise (`funding.applications.openCount`) to `/grants/applications`. When none are open, the sentence **No open applications.** is plain text, not a link. While the count is loading, the sentence is **Loading…**. When the load fails, the error sentence and **Try again** are shown, not the applications link. The profile no longer shows this card.
- **Inputs:** Session account via `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` / `useAuthStore`.
- **Actions:** Read verification or grant status. A basis account reads that it is not verified yet and does not open Apply. A verified account with status pending, trial, or admitted reads that copy, for every username. A verified account with status none or rejected named `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas` opens Apply. Every other verified account with status none or rejected reads the paused sentence and the statistics link. Signed-in accounts open **Goals** (`/grants/goals`). An initiator or founder opens **Daily payment text** or **Daily payment amounts**. An account at least moderator, including an initiator and a founder, opens **Open application (1)** or **Open applications (N)** only when N is at least 1. **Try again** repeats the load after an error.
- **Used by:** Route `/grants` (`GrantsPage`).

### Variant: default

Verified owner with `funding.status` **none**. Page `h1` **21 gifts grant**, the paused sentence **Applications are currently paused. You can apply again when shop transactions have increased.**, the link `https://21.gifts/statistics`, and **Goals**. No About link and no Apply button. Public paused screenshots are unchanged because those fixtures are not `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas`.

![21.gifts grants](images/grants.png)

### Variant: funding-apply

Verified username joey-rosima with status none or rejected sees Apply for the 21 gifts grant instead of the paused sentence.

![21.gifts grants funding apply](images/grants-funding-apply.png)

### Variant: funding-not-verified

Basis owner. Grant section on `/grants`. Copy **You are not verified yet.** plus how in-person verification works. No apply button.

![21.gifts profile funding not verified](images/profile-funding-not-verified.png)

### Variant: funding-pending

Verified owner with `funding.status` **pending**. Copy **Your application is open. A moderator will review your posts.**

![21.gifts profile funding pending](images/profile-funding-pending.png)

### Variant: funding-trial

Verified owner with `funding.status` **trial**. Copy **You are on a one-day trial. Review repeats tomorrow.**

![21.gifts profile funding trial](images/profile-funding-trial.png)

### Variant: funding-admitted

Verified owner with `funding.status` **admitted**. Copy **You are admitted to daily 21.gifts grant payouts.** plus **Takes part in the 21.gifts funding program since {date}**. When `reviewedByName` is set, that sentence names the reviewer. Trial, pending, and rejected do not show a name. The funding-program icon on the public facts is closed here. The pressed result is **funding-program-open**.
![21.gifts profile funding admitted](images/profile-funding-admitted.png)

### Variant: funding-program-open

Admitted owner on `/grants`. The participation sentence **Takes part in the 21.gifts funding program since {date}** is visible on the grant card. Viewport capture after scrolling that line into view.

![21.gifts profile funding program open](images/profile-funding-program-open.png)

### Variant: open-applications

Moderator on `/grants` with two open grant applications. The grant card is shown, and **Open applications (2)** links to `/grants/applications`. When the list is empty this control is the sentence **No open applications.** and not a link; that state is **no-applications**. Needle `state-grants-open-applications`.

![21.gifts grants open applications](images/grants-open-applications.png)

### Variant: no-applications

Moderator on `/grants` when no grant application is open. The sentence **No open applications.** is plain text, not a button or link. Needle `state-grants-no-applications`.

![21.gifts grants no applications](images/grants-no-applications.png)

### Variant: applications-loading

Moderator on `/grants` while open applications are still loading. Copy **Loading…** is plain text, not a link. Needle `state-grants-applications-loading`.

![21.gifts grants daily payments](images/grants-daily-payments.png)

## Screen: /grants/goals

- **Purpose:** Signed-in grant goal. States that the program continues at 10 active shops, that a shop is active with at least one transaction on 5 of the last 7 days, and what a transaction is. Shows how many shops meet that rule and a 7-day shop chart. The chart is not the public statistics series.
- **Inputs:** Session via `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` / `useAuthStore`. `GET /funding/goal` when a session exists.
- **Actions:** Read the goal, the transaction definition, the qualifying count, and the chart. **Try again** repeats the load after an error. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Used by:** Route `/grants/goals` (`GrantGoalsPage`). The **Goals** link on `/grants` opens it.

### Variant: default

Signed-in page with the goal loaded. Heading **Goals**. Copy **The grant program continues when we reach 10 active shops.** A shop is active on 5 of the last 7 days.

![21.gifts grant goals error](images/grants-goals-error.png)

## Screen: /grants/payments/comment

- **Purpose:** Signed-in editor for the daily payout comment only. An initiator or founder loads `GET /funding/daily-roster`. Everyone else who is signed in sees the heading plus **You cannot change daily payments.** and this page does not fetch. The comment is text until the pencil opens it. An empty comment shows **Not set**. This page has no default-amount sentence, no payments switch, no recipients, and no Add. There is no `route.ts` beside this page; JSON lives under `/funding/daily-roster`. Amounts are `/grants/payments/amounts`.
- **Inputs:** Session account via `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` / `useAuthStore`. Roster from `GET /funding/daily-roster` for an initiator or founder.
- **Actions:** The comment is text until the pencil (**Edit comment**) opens it. The check (**Save**) stores it and the X (**Cancel**) restores the stored comment. Neither word is shown. A save in flight replaces the check with a spinner. **Try again** repeats a failed load. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Used by:** Route `/grants/payments/comment` (`DailyPaymentCommentPage`). The **Daily payment text** link on `/grants` is shown only to an initiator or founder.

### Variant: default

Founder with a stored comment. Heading **Daily payment text**. Comment **Daily gift** is text, with the pencil **Edit comment** on the same line, to the right of the text. No recipients and no payments switch. Needle `Edit comment`.

![21.gifts daily payment text](images/grants-payments-comment.png)

### Variant: empty

![21.gifts daily payment text editing](images/grants-payments-comment-editing.png)

## Screen: /grants/payments/amounts

- **Purpose:** Signed-in editor for daily payout amounts only. An initiator or founder loads `GET /funding/daily-roster`. Everyone else who is signed in sees the heading plus **You cannot change daily payments.** and this page does not fetch. Under the heading, the loaded editor says everyone in the grant program receives the roster `defaultAmountUsd` by default, formatted with `formatUsdDisplay`, and that the page is only for entering a different amount by hand. Someone who should receive the default does not need to be listed. The figure is not written into the catalog. Recipient amounts are the USD figure spend stores (`amountUsd`), typed in `Field`, not `AmountEntry`. The total is that USD sum via `formatUsdDisplay` (visitor grouping, two decimals). The comment is not on this page. There is no `route.ts` beside this page; JSON lives under `/funding/daily-roster`.
- **Inputs:** Session account via `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` / `useAuthStore`. Roster from `GET /funding/daily-roster` for an initiator or founder.
- **Actions:** Turn payments **On** or **Off**. **Add** a recipient.

The shown name is the display name, or Unnamed when the name is null or blank. The add form's first field is Person. Typing `@` opens the first page of people. Further letters keep only usernames that start that way. Choosing one fills `@username` and leaves the list open. No address is typed or shown. The pencil opens the amount field; the check saves and the X cancels. **Try again** repeats a failed load. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Used by:** Route `/grants/payments/amounts` (`DailyPaymentAmountsPage`). The **Daily payment amounts** link on `/grants` is shown only to an initiator or founder.

### Variant: default

Founder with a loaded roster. Heading **Daily payment amounts**. The note begins **Everyone in the grant program receives $1.00 by default.** The row name Ada is a link to `/members/acc_ada`. A row without a name shows Unnamed and is not a link. Pencil accessible names are **Edit Ada** and **Edit Unnamed**. Payments **On** is pressed. The total is the USD sum, for this roster `$1.30`. The comment is not shown. Needle `Everyone in the grant program receives`.

## Screen: /profile/apply

- **Purpose:** Permanent redirect to `/grants/apply`. That page shows the pause sentence and `https://21.gifts/statistics` for a verified account with status `none` or `rejected` whose username is not `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas`. A verified account with one of those names and status `none` or `rejected` sees the apply walk. Pending, trial, and admitted keep their copy for every verified username. A basis account named joey-rosima, vincent, or jewel-bacolbas sees **You are not verified yet.** and does not post. Any other basis account whose status is not pending, trial, or admitted sees the pause card. A basis account with one of those statuses sees **You are not verified yet.** and does not post. This path renders no grant UI of its own.
- **Inputs:** None. The browser lands on `/grants/apply`.
- **Actions:** `redirect('/grants/apply')`.
- **Used by:** Old links to `/profile/apply`.

### Variant: redirect

Opening `/profile/apply` lands on the paused applications screen. Public paused screenshots are unchanged because those fixtures are not `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas`.

![21.gifts apply](images/profile-apply.png)

## Screen: /grants/apply

- **Purpose:** Signed-in applications screen. While applications are paused, a verified account with status `none` or `rejected` whose username is not `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas` sees the pause sentence and the link `https://21.gifts/statistics`, with no About-me steps, no questions, and no POST. Pending, trial, and admitted keep their copy for every verified username. A verified account with one of those three names and status `none` or `rejected` sees the apply walk. A basis account named joey-rosima, vincent, or jewel-bacolbas sees **You are not verified yet.** and does not post. Any other basis account whose status is not pending, trial, or admitted sees the pause card. A basis account with one of those statuses sees **You are not verified yet.** and does not post. The apply walk stays in the code. While the switch is on it is shown only for a verified account named `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas` with status `none` or `rejected`. When the switch is off, a verified account with status `none` or `rejected` sees it. Pending, trial, and admitted stay status copy. A basis account on that card sees **You are not verified yet.**
- **Inputs:** Account username and funding status from the auth store. Public paused fixtures do not fetch posts and do not POST apply.
- **Actions:** Read the paused sentence and open `https://21.gifts/statistics`, unless the signed-in username is `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas`, or the funding status is pending, trial, or admitted. A verified account with one of those names and status `none` or `rejected` fills the apply walk. Pending, trial, and admitted read their status. A basis account named joey-rosima, vincent, or jewel-bacolbas reads **You are not verified yet.** and does not post. Any other basis account whose status is not pending, trial, or admitted reads the pause card. A basis account with one of those statuses reads **You are not verified yet.** and does not post. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome`. No second arrow. The wordmark is not that control.
- **Used by:** Route `/grants/apply` (`FundingApplyPage`).

### Variant: default

Verified member, funding none. Heading **21 gifts grant**. The paused sentence. Link `https://21.gifts/statistics`. No Apply control. Public paused screenshots are unchanged because those fixtures are not `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas`.

## Screen: /messages

- **URL:** `/messages` — signed-in private-message inbox. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome`. Public notes stay at `/messages/[id]`.
- **What the user sees:** Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`) with `MessagesChromeLeft` + wordmark → `/welcome` top-left and one **Menu** top-right; open it for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Wordmark → `/welcome`. A thread opened from the list returns to the list; it does not always go to `/messages`. Heading **Messages**. Members see the unfiltered inbound list (all origins) with no `SegmentedControl`. Moderators see **Direct** | **Contact** | **Damus** (default **Direct**, one row) and a list of that origin only. Origin labels on rows stay for everyone. A `moderator_group` row is never listed; the closed staff room lives on `/moderate/group`. Member empty copy is **No private messages yet.** without the control; staff empty stays per-filter (**No private messages yet.** / **No contact messages yet.** / **No Damus messages yet.**) with the control visible. **Loading…** and **Try again** hide the control. Unread inbound rows are semibold with `text-app-fg` last text and a tabular-nums lining-nums unread-message count right of the name before the time when the derived count is greater than zero (`inbox.threadUnread` accessible name `{name}, {count} unread`; no visible word Unread); read inbound last text is a muted left preview; outbound last text is a filled right chip (`You: {text}`); gift-only last messages show the formatted amount. Open a thread (`?c=`) for the newest 20 messages, oldest-first within the page and a 8000-character composer plus an amount field with the ₿ / fiat switch and the other unit under it (no filter) with ImagePlus attach (JPEG/PNG/WebP max 10, photo-only send, stills in bubbles; the list has no attach): incoming bubbles are full-width muted note cards, sent bubbles are filled `app-btn` on the right labelled **You**. A pasted `https://21.gifts/messages/<uuid>` in a bubble unfurls as a nested quoted-note card (`ForumQuotedBody` / `fetchPublicMessage`). The bubble remainder uses conversation translate; nested forum quotes stay forum notes. The conversation list does not offer Translate. Older pages prepend near the oldest bubble. The open thread starts scrolled to the bottom (newest + composer) and stays there while the scroller is within 80px of the bottom, including when older pages prepend and when stills on the loaded page finish. Scrolling up unsticks; further prepends keep the same messages in view. A new newest message re-sticks. An open pay sheet is included in that bottom pin. Returning via the top-left arrow scrolls the conversation list to the top once when that previous view is the list. Opening a thread POSTs `/conversations/:id/read` and refreshes the home-screen badge. The open-thread heading is only the counterpart name + origin caption (no in-card back); the origin label sits under it, not inside the h1. Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false. Every settled sats amount in an open thread also shows the preferred-fiat suffix stored when the payment was made (a stored string as-is; the gift-day rate when that field is null or missing). Unpaid invoice previews still use the latest gift-day rate. A message whose `giftFor` points at another message renders as a footer inside that message instead of as a separate row. An open thread shows new messages without a reload, about every 5 seconds while the tab is visible, and once when the tab becomes visible again. A hidden tab does not poll.
- **Actions:** Open a thread, send a reply, attach JPEG/PNG/WebP stills on an open thread, return via the top-left arrow (when the previous view is the list, the list starts at the top), or to the forum when this tab has no earlier view. Open the counterpart (and incoming author) name to `/members/:id` when `accountId` is present. Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**. Member-profile Message and `/contact` send land here; dismiss `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` for this mount or follow **Write an introduction** to `/welcome`. Leave an open thread visible so new messages appear without a reload.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `MessagesChromeLeft`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `MessagesPage`, `InboxLoader`, `InboxScreen`, `ForumQuotedBody`, `SignedInChrome`, `IntroduceYourselfOverlay`, `OnboardingGate`, `fetchConversations`, `fetchConversation`, `fetchModeratorGroup` (`roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`, unlisted `?c=` only), `fetchConversationMessagePhoto`, `fetchPublicMessage`, `postConversationMessage`, `prepareForumPhoto`, `postConversationInvoice`, `markConversationRead`, `refreshUnreadAppBadge`.
- **Auth:** Bearer session; `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`.

Chooser absent.

![21.gifts inbox thread](images/messages-thread.png)

Captured at desktop and mobile (same variant, four combos). Desktop shows the Bitcoin payment QR plus the wallet **Pay** button. A smartphone shows the same sheet without a mounted `QrCode`; **Pay** opens Wallet of Satoshi. **Waiting for payment…** is acceptable while the pay poll hangs.

![21.gifts inbox thread pay QR](images/messages-thread-pay-qr.png)

### Variant: thread-quoted-note

Open Direct thread. Incoming bubble text includes a public forum note URL; the nested quoted-note card shows **A Quick Technical Note** and hides the raw `https://21.gifts/messages/<uuid>` URL.

![21.gifts inbox thread quoted note](images/messages-thread-quoted-note.png)

## Screen: /notifications

- **URL:** `/notifications` — signed-in notifications for living-room posts, replies, payments, moderator appointment, and moderator proposal. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome`. Public notes stay at `/messages/[id]`. JSON is `/forum/notifications` (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page).
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` (the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; wordmark → `/welcome`), and Menu, inside the rounded sheet). Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`). Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, and **Log out**. Heading **Notifications**, a list of posts, replies, payments, moderator appointment, and moderator proposal (actor `{name} posted` / `{name} replied` / `{name} sent bitcoin` / `{name} proposed a moderator`, or **You are a moderator** without `{name}`; post or reply text or **Photo** / **Photo reaction**; zap amount as stored; appointment or proposal with empty text has no body line; time), empty copy **No notifications yet.**, **Loading…**, or **Try again**. Unread rows (`readAt` absent) are a section headed **Unread** above rows that already have `readAt`, headed **Already seen**. Each section keeps the fetched order, and a section with no rows is omitted. Unread rows are semibold; read rows muted. No composer and no filter. Signed-in chrome may show `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` when `setup` is null and `hasPosted` is false. Visiting this screen / mark-all-read treats notification unread as 0; the badge becomes remaining inbox unread plus remaining staff-room unread (0 or 1). Visiting this screen does not clear staff-room unread.
- **Actions:** Click a `moderator_proposal` row to open `/moderate/proposals` (does **not** mark that notification read). Click a `moderator_appointed` row to open `/welcome` (mark that notification read). Click a `forum_reply` or `forum_mention` row to open `/messages/{replyId}`, and a `forum_post` or `zap` row to open `/messages/{parentId}` (mark that notification read; ids are URI-encoded). The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Open **Menu** for **Home**, **Shops**, **Point of sale**, Profile, **Grants**, **Wallet**, **Living room rules**, **Habit-Tracker**, **Trust Chain**, **Statistics**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Contact**, optional **Install app**, or **Log out**.

## Screen: /statistics

- **URL:** `/statistics` — people-count and shop-activity charts for every visitor, signed-in or not. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` with `allowGuest`. A signed-out visitor is not sent to `/login`. Incomplete signed-in setup still is. HTML `/statistics` is the chart page, not a GET proxy (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page). JSON is `GET /gifts/stats`. Not a second moderation hub. No daily funding goal on this page.
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` (the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; wordmark → `/welcome`), and either **Log in** or Menu, inside the rounded sheet). Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`). Heading **Statistics**. Signed-out top-right is **Log in**, not Menu. A session still shows Menu. Both see the **People paid** panel: yesterday's person count, the measurement paragraph, and the **People by UTC day** chart (lighter bar is today, no goal line). Both also see an **Active shops** panel under it: one explainer and the **Shops by UTC day** chart. The shop chart has no goal line and no link. The people panel is always open. No **Tap to close**. No Goal, percent, progress bar, or goal line. No Hidden notes, Open proposals, Moderators chat group, or Handbook controls. When `roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')` and yesterday's person count is a number, a closed **Moderator functions** disclosure (`StaffFunctions`, catalog `staff.functions`) sits between the people chart and the shop panel; opening it shows **Show payout per person** (`moderate.payouts.link`) to `/moderate/payouts`. Basis and verified never see **Moderator functions**. A signed-out visitor never sees **Moderator functions**. Menu row **Statistics** (`nav.statistics`, lucide `BarChart3`, `/statistics`) for a signed-in account, immediately after Trust Chain. Menu row **Moderation** stays staff-only immediately after Statistics.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Signed-out visitors open **Log in**. A session opens **Menu**. No note list on this page. The shop chart has no drill-down. Staff may open **Moderator functions** then **Show payout per person**.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `StatisticsPage`, `StatisticsScreen`, `PeopleCountChart`, `ShopActivityChart`, `StaffFunctions`, `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `fetchGiftStats`, `fetchShopActivity`.
- **Auth:** No bearer required to read the page. Fetch `GET /gifts/stats` and `GET /shops/activity` with or without a session. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` with `allowGuest`. Each request fails on its own. Closed **Moderator functions** only when `roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')` and yesterday's count is a number.

### Variant: default

Staff (moderator) page with heading **Statistics**, the **People paid** panel always open (yesterday count, measurement paragraph, 30-UTC-day chart). Closed **Moderator functions** sits between the people chart and the shop chart; **Show payout per person** is not visible yet. The shop chart sits under that disclosure (**Shops by UTC day**). The people panel is not a toggle.

![21.gifts statistics](images/statistics.png)

### Variant: loading

Staff (moderator) page. Both panels show **Loading…** while their own request is in flight: the people panel (group **People paid**) for `GET /gifts/stats`, and the shop panel (group **Active shops**) for `GET /shops/activity`. One panel can finish while the other is still loading. **Moderator functions** is not shown.

![21.gifts statistics loading](images/statistics-loading.png)

### Variant: error

Staff (moderator) page. The people panel shows **Could not load payouts. Please try again.** and **Try again**. The shop panel under it still shows **Shops by UTC day**. The two panels fail independently. **Moderator functions** is not shown.

![21.gifts statistics error](images/statistics-error.png)

### Variant: member

A basis account sees both charts and both explainers. No **Moderator functions**. No **This page is for moderators.**

![21.gifts statistics member](images/statistics-member.png)

### Variant: signed-out

No session. Top-right is **Log in** instead of Menu. Both charts. No **Moderator functions**.

![21.gifts statistics signed out](images/statistics-signed-out.png)

### Variant: staff-open

A founder clicks **Moderator functions**, then **Show payout per person** is visible.

![21.gifts statistics staff open](images/statistics-staff-open.png)

### Variant: shop-error

Staff (moderator) page. The people chart stays up (**People by UTC day**). Closed **Moderator functions** sits between the people chart and the shop panel; **Show payout per person** is not visible yet. The shop panel under it shows **Could not load shop activity. Please try again.** and **Try again**.

![21.gifts statistics shop error](images/statistics-shop-error.png)

### Variant: both-error

Staff (moderator) page. The people panel shows **Could not load payouts. Please try again.** and the shop panel shows **Could not load shop activity. Please try again.** **Moderator functions** is not shown.

![21.gifts statistics both error](images/statistics-both-error.png)

## Screen: /moderate

- **URL:** `/moderate` — signed-in moderation hub for moderators. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome` (`OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`). HTML `/moderate` is the hub, not a GET proxy; this page does not fetch hidden notes, proposals, applications, or gift stats. The Open proposals count comes from `useUnreadCount` (`GET /trust/proposals`); the queue itself is `/moderate/proposals`. JSON for hidden notes lives under `/forum/messages/hidden`; JSON for open proposals lives under `/trust/proposals`; JSON for grant applications lives under `/funding/applications` (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page).
- **What the user sees:** Chrome is the page-frame header (`ProfileChromeLeft` (the arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none; wordmark → `/welcome`), and Menu, inside the rounded sheet). Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`). Heading **Moderation**. Staff (moderator) see a labeled **Goals** `ButtonLink` (`variant="secondary"` `size="lg"`) to `/grants/goals` (first tool), a labeled **Hidden notes** `ButtonLink` (`variant="secondary"` `size="lg"`) to `/moderate/hidden`, a labeled **Open proposals** `ButtonLink` (`variant="secondary"` `size="lg"`) to `/moderate/proposals` that shows a count when `proposalCount` > 0 (`moderate.proposals.unread`, accessible name like Open proposals, 1 unread), **Moderators chat group** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/group`, **Handbook** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/handbook`, and **Show payout per person** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/payouts` (last tool). Hub **Moderators chat group** ButtonLink shows a count when staff-room unread (`moderationUnreadCount - proposalCount`) is greater than zero (`moderate.groupUnread`, accessible name like Moderators chat group, 1 unread); href stays `/moderate/group`. Non-staff signed-in visitors see the heading plus **This page is for moderators.** and no tools list. Menu row **Statistics** sits before Moderation. Menu row **Moderation** (`nav.moderate`, lucide `Shield`, `/moderate`) only when `roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`, after **Statistics**. Staff Menu row **Moderation** shows a count when staff-room unread plus open-proposal count is greater than zero (`nav.moderateUnread`, accessible name like Moderation, 1 unread); href stays `/moderate`. Menu has no Open proposals row.
- **Actions:** Open **Goals** to `/grants/goals`. Open **Hidden notes** to `/moderate/hidden`. Open **Open proposals** to `/moderate/proposals`. Moderators also open **Moderators chat group** to `/moderate/group`. Open **Handbook** to `/moderate/handbook`. Open **Show payout per person** to `/moderate/payouts`. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Open **Menu**. No list fetch and no un-hide control on this page. Hub does not fetch proposals, applications, or gift stats itself (Open proposals count comes from `useUnreadCount`).
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `ModeratePage`, `ModerateScreen`, `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `useUnreadCount`.
- **Auth:** Bearer session; `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`. Hub tools only when `roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`; others see forbidden copy and do not fetch. This page does not call `GET /gifts/stats`.

### Variant: default

Staff (moderator) hub with heading **Moderation**, labeled **Goals** control → `/grants/goals`, labeled **Hidden notes** control → `/moderate/hidden`, labeled **Open proposals** control → `/moderate/proposals`, **Moderators chat group** control → `/moderate/group`, **Handbook** control → `/moderate/handbook`, and **Show payout per person** → `/moderate/payouts`. No goal widget.

![21.gifts moderation](images/moderate.png)

### Variant: group-unread

Staff hub with an unread Moderators chat group. **Moderators chat group** control shows **1** and accessible name **Moderators chat group, 1 unread** (`moderate.groupUnread`). Goals, Hidden notes, Open proposals, Handbook, and Show payout per person unchanged.

## Screen: /moderate/payouts

- **URL:** `/moderate/payouts` — signed-in staff table of daily-grant payouts per person. Same onboarding gate as `/moderate` (`OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`). HTML `/moderate/payouts` is the table, not a GET proxy. JSON is `GET /funding/payout-days`. Hub is `/moderate`.
- **What the user sees:** Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`) with one top-left arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`) that returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none, plus wordmark → `/welcome`. The wordmark is not that control. One **Menu** sits top-right. No in-card back. Heading **Payout per person**. Staff see the lead (seven UTC days, today on the right, moderator stipends excluded), a legend (**Not entitled**, **Entitled, not collected**, **Payout received**, **Welcome gift**), then a table: **Name** plus seven day columns, oldest on the left and today on the right (the last header also says **today**). Cells are color blocks: black not entitled, white entitled but not collected, green payout received, amber for a welcome gift alone, and a split green/amber cell when both were received. A name with an account id links to `/members/{id}`. Empty copy **Nobody was entitled in these seven days.** Loading… or error plus **Try again**. Non-staff see the heading plus **This page is for moderators.** and no table.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control (wordmark → `/welcome`). Open a member when the row has an account id. **Try again** after a load error. Open **Menu**.
- **Calls:** `PayoutsPage`, `FundingPayoutsScreen`, `fetchFundingPayoutDays`.
- **Auth:** Bearer session; `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`. The table fetches only when `roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`.

### Variant: default

Staff table with one person, Ada: amber for a welcome gift alone, white for entitled but not collected, a split green/amber cell when both were received, and black for the remaining days. Today is the rightmost column.

## Screen: /moderate/hidden

- **URL:** `/moderate/hidden` — signed-in hidden-notes list for moderators. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome` (`OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`). HTML `/moderate/hidden` is the hidden-notes page, not a GET proxy. JSON is `/forum/messages/hidden` (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page).
- **What the user sees:** Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`) with one top-left arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`) that returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none, plus wordmark → `/welcome`. The wordmark is not that control. One **Menu** sits top-right. No in-card back. Heading **Hidden notes**. Staff (moderator) see the lead copy about a soft hide (the note and its untagged direct replies leave the living room; not a hard delete), then the hidden-note list newest-hidden first (author, a non-interactive **External** badge next to the name when the row has a `via` value, text with Languages **Translate** outside the name link, **Hidden by {name}** / **Unnamed**, created and hidden times), empty copy **No hidden notes.**, **Loading…**, or **Try again**. Non-staff signed-in visitors see the heading plus **This page is for moderators.** and no list. No un-hide control. No hidden photo/video fetch.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control (wordmark → `/welcome`). The row stays the link to the note. When `accountId` is set, the name beside that link is the member button. External rows stay text. Tap the rest of the row to open `/messages/:id`. **Translate** (Languages icon) sits under the note text when it differs from the UI locale (staff permalink shows the note plus who hid it and when). Open **Menu**. Staff **Try again** on list error. No un-hide control on this page.

- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `HiddenNotesPage`, `HiddenNotesScreen`, `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `listHiddenMessages`.

## Screen: /moderate/group

- **URL:** `/moderate/group` — signed-in closed moderator group thread. Same onboarding gate as `/welcome` (`OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`). HTML `/moderate/group` is the group page, not a GET proxy. JSON is `/conversations/moderator-group` (Next.js forbids `route.ts` beside this page).
- **What the user sees:** Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`) with one top-left arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`) that returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none, plus wordmark → `/welcome`. The wordmark is not that control. One **Menu** sits top-right. No in-card back. Heading **Moderators chat group**. Moderators fetch the singleton group then the newest 20-message page and reuse `InboxScreen` (no origin filter; no in-card back). The loaded heading is the catalog label **Moderators chat group** (never the api row name); the composer has **Add a photo** (JPEG/PNG/WebP, up to 10) and no **Amount** field (no gifts). A pasted `https://21.gifts/messages/<uuid>` unfurls as a nested quoted-note card. The bubble remainder uses conversation translate; nested forum quotes stay forum notes. There is no conversation list. The loaded staff-room thread starts scrolled to the bottom (newest + composer) and stays there while the scroller is within 80px of the bottom, including when older pages prepend and when stills on the loaded page finish. Scrolling up unsticks; further prepends keep the same messages in view. A new newest message re-sticks. Older pages prepend near the oldest bubble. After a successful group+thread load, opening the room POSTs `/conversations/:id/read` (same as opening an inbox thread), bumps the badge epoch, and refreshes the home-screen badge with staff-room unread 0. Other signed-in visitors see heading **Moderators chat group** plus **This room is for moderators.** and do not fetch. Loading **Loading…**. Error **Try again**. Empty thread: composer visible, no messages. A thread message that another message's `giftFor` points at shows that gift attached under it as a compact `role="note"` line (name, ₿ amount, preferred-fiat suffix, time) instead of as its own bubble. Every sats amount in the thread (gift-only, text+sats, and the nested line) shows the same preferred-fiat suffix the forum already shows, (a stored string as-is; the gift-day rate when that field is null or missing). The open room shows new messages without a reload, about every 5 seconds while the tab is visible, and once when the tab becomes visible again. A hidden tab does not poll.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control (wordmark → `/welcome`). Open **Menu**. Moderators attach photos, send a reply (text and/or photos), and **Try again** on fetch error. After a successful group+thread load, opening the room POSTs `/conversations/:id/read` (same as opening an inbox thread), bumps the badge epoch, and refreshes the home-screen badge with staff-room unread 0. Leave the room open so new messages appear without a reload.
- **Calls:** `AppShell`, `ProfileChromeLeft`, `ModeratorGroupPage`, `ModeratorGroupScreen`, `InboxScreen`, `ForumQuotedBody`, `SignedInChrome`, `OnboardingGate`, `fetchModeratorGroup`, the newest 20-message page via `fetchConversation`, `fetchConversationMessagePhoto`, `fetchPublicMessage`, `postConversationMessage`, `prepareForumPhoto`, `markConversationRead`, `refreshUnreadAppBadge`.

Signed-in (hydrated session and account): same per-note actions as `/welcome` (React on the root note, copy link on the root note and on every reply, Gift on a payable nested reply, expand/replies + reply composer, staff delete, **Edit shop note** on a top-level shop note when the viewer is a moderator, author link when `accountId`). A founder or moderator opening a soft-hidden note (root or highlighted reply) sees the note plus `forum.hiddenNotice` (who hid it and when) instead of `view.missing`; React/Gift/Delete/reply composer are omitted on that card. A compose-fee reply invoices 1 sat to 21.gifts on the composer slot (`payHost: composer`, `payMessageId` = compose-target note) even though the top-level composer is hidden; extra gifts and Gift-open stay on the card (`payHost: card`). Still no `OnboardingGate`, no top-level composer, no envelope, no FiatPicker, no feed filters. Auto-expand when signed in. Fill `AppShell` (`align="center"`) via `PublicMessageChrome`. No auth gate to view; chrome depends on hydrated session. Unsigned (no session): `ProfileChromeLeft` with wordmark → `/` and one arrow to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none, plus light LanguageSwitcher. Hydrated session: `ProfileChromeLeft` (the same arrow; wordmark → `/welcome`) + `SignedInChrome` (Menu with **Home** first). Amounts are `formatBitcoin` plus optional preferred-fiat `·` `formatFiatDisplay` of the amount stored when the payment was made (a stored string as-is; a null or missing field uses the gift-day rate). A posted goal bar uses the frozen snapshot when that string exists, otherwise the gift-day rate. The pay sheet and an unpaid invoice preview still use the gift-day rate. Signed-in: **Translate** (Languages icon) sits in the footer icon row with react / copy. Unsigned `PublicThreadCard` stacks Translate under the body (no footer row). **Show original** / **Show translation** stay the same Languages icon, with no visible text. Offered when the note language differs from the UI locale.
- **Inputs:** Dynamic route `id` (UUID). After hydrate: any session loads `GET /forum/messages/:id` (`fetchForumMessage`) and Bearer replies (a hidden note is still 404 for a non-moderator). No session uses `GET /public-messages/:id` and public replies. A `via === 'nostr'` name links to `/messages/[id]/author`; any other unsigned name stays text. A session shows the member link for a 21.gifts author (`accountId` wins over `via`) on the note, a reaction, a quote name (the rest of the quote still opens the note), and the same on hidden notes and the pin list. A signed-in name with no account and `via === 'nostr'` opens `/messages/[id]/author`. The public note video has its own fullscreen button, including a narrow portrait clip. If the opened note has `parentId`, a second GET loads that parent, then its replies. Opening a reply UUID shows the parent post and all live replies; opening a parent UUID shows that post and all live replies. Opening a hidden reply UUID as staff still shows the parent, live replies, AND the opened hidden reply (merged if Bearer replies omit it). Both URLs stay valid (no redirect). Signed-in also auto-expands via Bearer `GET /forum/messages/:id/replies`. Optional photo via `fetchPublicMessagePhoto` or signed-in `fetchMessagePhoto` (via `PublicMessageThread`) → blob URL. Invalid UUID → missing without a fetch. A replies 404 after a successful parent GET is an error, not empty. Server `generateMetadata` loads api `GET /messages/:id` (via `loadPublicMessageForOg`) and sets Open Graph / Twitter tags. Unsigned/non-staff hidden ids stay `view.missing`.
- **Actions:** Change language (unsigned), or open **Menu** (signed-in). The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view in this tab, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. One arrow. The wordmark is not that control. Unsigned **Log in** → `/login` (`login.submit`) below the thread. Signed-in visitors have no second back link below the thread, plus the per-note actions above (React on the root note, copy link on the root note and on every reply, Gift on a payable nested reply, expand/replies + reply composer, staff delete, **Edit shop note** on a top-level shop note when the viewer is a moderator, author link when `accountId`). A compose-fee reply invoices 1 sat to 21.gifts on the composer slot (`payHost: composer`); extra gifts stay on the card (`payHost: card`). On fetch error, **Try again**. States reuse `view.missing` / `view.error`+retry / `forum.loading`.

- **Used by:** Route `/messages/[id]` (`PublicMessagePage`). Shared links copied from the forum board.
- **Calls:** `PublicMessagePage`, `PublicMessageChrome`, `PublicMessageLoader`, `PublicThreadCard`, `PublicMessageThread`, `ForumGoalBar`, `forumGoalPercent`, `ForumQuotedBody`, `NoteTranslate`, `LanguageSwitcher`.

### Variant: default

Valid known UUID. Thread may be parent-only when replies are empty. Card with author name, timestamp, text (`Hello from Ada`), sats via `formatBitcoin` plus optional preferred-fiat `·` `formatFiatDisplay` of the amount stored when the payment was made (otherwise the gift-day rate; no ` · —` when that rate is unusable), optional photo or clip-aspect `<video>`. Auth CTA below the card.

![21.gifts public message](images/messages-id.png)

### Variant: mention-suggest

Signed in. The root note is expanded, the reaction field contains `@`, and the People list is open.

![21.gifts public message mention suggestions](images/messages-id-mention-suggest.png)

### Variant: mention-inserted

Choosing `@ada` from that open list writes `@ada ` into the reaction field and closes the list.

![21.gifts public message mention inserted](images/messages-id-mention-inserted.png)

### Variant: place

Unsigned permalink of Ada's note **Hello from Ada** with a place. The card shows a MapPin link **Happyland** to `/map?pin=<id>`.

![21.gifts public message place](images/messages-id-place.png)

### Variant: place-coords

Unsigned permalink of the same note with no place label. The MapPin link reads **14.60000, 120.98000**.

![21.gifts public message place coordinates](images/messages-id-place-coords.png)

### Variant: goal-110

Unsigned permalink of a top-level Ada note with `sats: 23100` and `goalSats: 21000`. The ask is defined in bitcoin, so `ForumGoalBar` names **Ask ₿21'000 · $21.00** and the note amount is **₿23'100 · $23.10** (viewer USD from the gift-day rate). Full orange track plus green overflow (10% of track width past the right edge), label **110%**. Auth CTA below the card. No composer Ask.

![21.gifts public message goal 110](images/messages-id-goal-110.png)

### Variant: goal-fiat

Unsigned permalink of an English note defined as **$1.50** with frozen **₿1'000** and label **0%**. No second dollar amount. The note matches the UI language, so the card does not offer Translate. The received amount is **₿0 · $0.00**. No composer Ask.

![21.gifts public message fiat goal](images/messages-id-goal-fiat.png)

### Variant: goal-credit

Unsigned permalink of a top-level Ada note with `sats: 10500`, `goalSats: 21000`, `goalRepayable: true`, and `goalTermDays: 30`. The ask is defined in bitcoin, so the bar shows **Ask ₿21'000 · $21.00**, the note amount **₿10'500 · $10.50**, a **Loan** tag and **To repay per day: ₿700 · $0.70 per day for 30 days.** Label **50%**. No composer Ask.

![21.gifts public message credit goal](images/messages-id-goal-credit.png)

### Variant: loan-tag-open

Same unsigned credit, after **Loan** is pressed. A line under the name says a loan is paid back.

![21.gifts public message loan tag open](images/messages-id-loan-tag-open.png)

### Variant: donation-tag-open

Same unsigned note as **goal-110**, after **Donation** is pressed. A line under the name says a donation is a gift and is not paid back.

![21.gifts public message donation tag open](images/messages-id-donation-tag-open.png)

### Variant: credit-ledger

Unsigned permalink of a filled credit. Under the ask, **Given** lists Bea @bea at ₿20 and Cara @cara at ₿1. **Paid back** shows a chart from 27 Sep 2026 to 28 Sep 2026, bars for each day's amount and a line from the whole debt down to zero, and **Each share is one bitcoin payment to that person.** The day rows are not on this page. **Repayment list** links to /messages/<id>/repayment-list.

![21.gifts public message credit ledger](images/messages-id-credit-ledger.png)

### Variant: photos

Unsigned permalink. Ada note with `photoCount` 2 and empty text. `ForumPhotoGallery` is a horizontal snap row (`data-scroll-x`, 88% peek) with a `1/2` chip and dots.

![21.gifts public message photos](images/messages-id-photos.png)

### Variant: note-video-paused

Unsigned permalink of Ada's note **A clip**. The picture is a video. The play button and the fullscreen button sit on that picture. The picture is centered.

![21.gifts public message note video paused](images/messages-id-note-video-paused.png)

### Variant: note-video-playing

Same public note after **Play**. The play button is gone. The fullscreen button stays on the picture.

![21.gifts public message note video playing](images/messages-id-note-video-playing.png)

### Variant: signed-in

Hydrated Ada session: one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) + wordmark → `/welcome`. The wordmark is not that control. **Menu** top-right (**Home** first). Thread card **Hello from Ada**, React, copy link, and **Write a reaction** (auto-expanded). Posts do not show Gift or an envelope.

![21.gifts public message signed in](images/messages-id-signed-in.png)

### Variant: shop-edit

A moderator session on a top-level shop note **Cafe Luna**. The footer shows **Edit shop note**. The editor is closed.

![21.gifts public message shop edit](images/messages-id-shop-edit.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-open

The same moderator clicked **Edit shop note**. Step **1 / 5 · Photos** is open. **History** says there are no edits yet. The photo step dismisses with an icon-only Close (X). Its accessible name is Cancel. There is no visible Cancel word. The closed pencil does not cover this result.

![21.gifts public message shop edit open](images/messages-id-shop-edit-open.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-place

The same moderator pressed **Next**. Step **2 / 5 · Place** is open. **History** still says there are no edits yet. The photo step's Close (X) is gone. The closed pencil does not cover this result.

![21.gifts public message shop edit place](images/messages-id-shop-edit-place.png)

### Variant: shop-edit-text

![21.gifts public message shop edit summary](images/messages-id-shop-edit-summary.png)

### Variant: sunday

Device-local Sunday. **Hello from Ada** stays. **Write a reaction** is gone. **Writing is paused on Sunday.**

![21.gifts public message sunday](images/messages-id-sunday.png)

![21.gifts public message translate loading](images/messages-id-translate-loading.png)

![21.gifts public message thread](images/messages-id-thread.png)

### Variant: external-reply

Unsigned permalink card (`PublicThreadCard`). Parent Ada “Hello from Ada” plus two replies from **Robin**, who has no 21.gifts account: a gift-only reply (`₿69`) and a text reply containing `https://example.com/hello`. Each name is a **View profile** control to `/messages/<id>/author`. This shot stays on the thread. **External** stays a non-interactive span next to the name (same slot as a role pill; not a button, no hint). The URL is visible as plain text — not a clickable link, no autolink, no quoted-note embed.

![21.gifts public message external reply](images/messages-id-external-reply.png)

### Variant: quoted-note

Public permalink of Riana Rosello's note. Cyrill's reply shows `just for information:` plus the same nested technical-note post (photo, caption, Founder, ₿43). Raw URL not visible.

![21.gifts public message reply received](images/messages-id-reply-received.png)

## Screen: /messages/[id]/repayment-list

- **Purpose:** The repayment list for one credit note: who gave, the chart, and every day's shares. The day rows render only here. The note, the forum, and a profile show a link instead of those rows. Nothing renders until the public ledger loads. A failed read stays blank. Chrome is PublicMessageChrome. There is no second back control.
- **Inputs:** Dynamic route `id`. Loads `GET /messages/:id/repayment` through `getRepayment`. No session is required to view. Chrome follows the hydrated session.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow is the existing ProfileChromeLeft control (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none). No other control. Names are text.
- **Used by:** Route `/messages/[id]/repayment-list` (`RepaymentListPage`). The **Repayment list** link on a collapsed `ForumGoalBar` and on `CreditLedger` summary.
- **Auth:** None required to view. Chrome depends on the hydrated session. No OnboardingGate.

### Variant: default

Unsigned. **Given** lists Bea @bea at ₿20 and Cara @cara at ₿1. **Paid back** shows the chart from 27 Sep 2026 to 28 Sep 2026, then **Each share is one bitcoin payment to that person.**, then 27 Sep 2026 with Bea's ₿10 **Due**, and 28 Sep 2026 with Bea's ₿10 and Cara's ₿1 **Scheduled**. This page has no **Repayment list** link.

![21.gifts repayment list](images/messages-id-repayment-list.png)

### Variant: signed-in

Same loaded list as the default, with the **Menu** control. **Given** lists Bea @bea at ₿20 and Cara @cara at ₿1. **Paid back** shows the chart from 27 Sep 2026 to 28 Sep 2026, then **Each share is one bitcoin payment to that person.**, then 27 Sep 2026 with Bea's ₿10 **Due**, and 28 Sep 2026 with Bea's ₿10 and Cara's ₿1 **Scheduled**. This page has no **Repayment list** link.

![21.gifts repayment list signed in](images/messages-id-repayment-list-signed-in.png)

### Variant: loading

Unsigned chrome only. The repayment request has not returned, so **Given**, the chart, and the day rows are absent. A failed read is this same blank screen: nothing is added and the layout does not change, so it is not a separate variant.

![21.gifts repayment list loading](images/messages-id-repayment-list-loading.png)

### Variant: empty

Unsigned. The ledger loaded with no givers and no repayment rows. **Given** shows **No one has given yet.** **Paid back** shows **Each share is one bitcoin payment to that person.** and **The days are fixed once the credit is fully given. Until then this is the plan for what has been given.** No chart and no day rows.

![21.gifts repayment list empty](images/messages-id-repayment-list-empty.png)

## Screen: /messages/[id]/author

- **Purpose:** External author profile card for a forum note whose author has no 21.gifts account. Not a member page and not a dialog. Heading is `profile.title` (**Profile** / **Profil** / **Perfil** / **Profile**), not the person's name. Name section always: heading `name.heading`, truncated name, **External** span (not a button). Optional checked Nostr address (`forum.externalProfileNip05`) when published. Payment address (`forum.externalProfileLud16`) only when it differs ignoring case. Nostr key (`forum.externalProfileNpub`) with the centered secondary IconButton copy control when a profile has loaded; addresses and the key are `break-all`, the name truncates. No photo, pay, outbound link, location, chart, about, message, hint paragraph, or close control. Count buttons appear when both `postCount` and `replyCount` are numbers; the feed is read-only under the card (no pay, no composer, no react); a post opens `/messages/{id}`; a reply opens `/messages/{parentId}`; a shorter list shows `profile.activityLatest`; loading uses `forum.loading`; failure uses `forum.error` and `view.retry`. If either count is absent, no buttons. Loading and a null fetch show the title, the fallback name (or Unnamed), and the External span, and omit the address sections. Body is `ExternalAuthorProfile` inside `PublicMessageChrome`.
- **Inputs:** Dynamic route `id` (forum message id, not validated as a UUID) and optional `name` query (`string` or first array entry, trimmed; blank becomes `''`). Profile from `GET /public-messages/:id/external-profile` (`fetchExternalAuthorProfile`). Posts from `GET /public-messages/:id/external-posts` and replies from `GET /public-messages/:id/external-replies`, no Bearer.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow is the existing `ProfileChromeLeft` control (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none). Unsigned chrome is wordmark href `/` plus `LanguageSwitcher`. Signed-in chrome is `ProfileChromeLeft` plus `SignedInChrome`. Copy the npub (icon-only **Copy** → **Copied**). Open and close the count buttons; those clicks GET `/public-messages/:id/external-posts` or `/public-messages/:id/external-replies`. No pay, no outbound link, no close control.
- **Used by:** Route `/messages/[id]/author` (`ExternalAuthorPage`). `ForumBoard`, `QuotedForumNote`, and `PublicMessageLoader` name controls.
- **Auth:** None required to view; chrome depends on hydrated session. No `OnboardingGate`. Not a `/members` page.

### Variant: default

Signed-out loaded card. Heading **Profile**, name **Robin**, **External**, **Verified Nostr address** `robin@nostr.example`, **Payment address on their profile** `pay@ln.example`, **Nostr key** `npub1example`, icon-only **Copy**. No photo, pay, outbound link, hint paragraph, or close control. Closed buttons are **1 post** and **1 reaction**; the feed is closed.

![21.gifts external author profile](images/messages-id-author.png)

### Variant: signed-in

Same loaded card with the **Menu** control. Heading **Profile**, **Robin**, **External**, `robin@nostr.example`, `pay@ln.example`, `npub1example`, icon-only **Copy**. Closed buttons are **1 post** and **1 reaction**; the feed is closed.

![21.gifts external author profile signed in](images/messages-id-author-signed-in.png)

## Screen: /view/[viewKey]

- **Purpose:** Public read-only copy of the signed-in profile card (heading Profile, AccountActivityChart Given/Received with FiatPicker only while `useHydrateSession().ready && session === null`, CHF|EUR|USD|PHP, `shell="app"`; unsigned empty = picker + `profile.chartEmpty` with no SVG / no ₿|fiat scale; signed-in empty = `profile.chartEmpty` alone; a failed activity load is `profile.chartError`; populated ₿ | selected fiat; About me inside the identity card — not a forum post; Languages **Translate** when `aboutMessageId` is set; with the photo when `aboutMeHasPhoto` — name + location + public `username@21.gifts` (`view.noGiftsAddress` when unset)) without edit/Message/back/menu/logout. Copy-profile-link on the card. Capability URL `/view/<64-hex>`; key/URL not shown as visible text. No `OnboardingGate` on this route. When a username is set, a centered `QrCode` (label `profile.giftsQr`) under the address encodes `openCryptoPayQrValue` (`https://<domain>/pl/?lightning=` plus the uppercase LNURL of `https://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<local>`), including on a smartphone. A missing username shows no QR.
- **Inputs:** Dynamic route `viewKey` (must be 64 lowercase hex). Profile from same-origin `GET /view-key/:viewKey` (`fetchViewProfile`); Given + Received from `GET /view-key/:viewKey/activity` (`fetchViewActivity`). Fetch even when address is blank; activity failure keeps the card and the chart shows `profile.chartError`. Identity still `GET /view-key/:viewKey`.
- **Actions:** The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. Change language (`HomeWordmark` beside that arrow: `/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; light language switcher top-right). Copy the profile link on the card (`profile.copyLink` **Copy link to this profile** → the current view URL). On profile fetch error, **Try again**. Unsigned empty series shows FiatPicker + `profile.chartEmpty`; signed-in empty is `profile.chartEmpty` alone. A failed activity load is `profile.chartError`. A filled series can switch scale between ₿ and the selected fiat. When unsigned, pick CHF|EUR|USD|PHP on the chart FiatPicker. When the card is ready and `hasPasskey` is false in a real browser: yellow banner under the card via `ViewProfileClaim` with **Action required, the account must be activated** and **Activate** — including when another 21.gifts account is already signed in. **Activate** clears that session (if any) then starts `register(viewKey)`. In Telegram or another in-app browser, the shared escape card (**Open this page in your browser**, **Open in browser**, **Copy link**) appears on mount instead of the banner. Hidden when the profile already has a passkey. After a successful claim → `/setup/rules`. No edit/Message/back/menu/logout on the card.
- **Used by:** Route `/view/[viewKey]` (`ViewProfilePage`).

### Variant: default

Valid known key. Heading **Profile**, FiatPicker only while unsigned; empty series shows FiatPicker + `profile.chartEmpty` when unsigned (**No gifts yet.**, no legend/SVG / no ₿|fiat scale; never **Loading…** on the chart) and `profile.chartEmpty` alone when signed in (a failed activity load is `profile.chartError`), About me inside the card when `aboutMe` is a string (not a forum post), icon-only **Copy link to this profile**, name, location, and Wallet of Satoshi address field labels, yellow **Action required, the account must be activated** / **Activate** banner under the card when unclaimed (even if signed in), no visible view-key URL/text. The card has no back control; the page header has the one top-left arrow.

### Variant: about-filled

Valid known key with a filled About me (`aboutMe` is a real bio, not a name-copy). Same read-only card as default plus the About me heading and body text. Copy-profile-link remains. No edit.

## Screen: /handbook

- **URL:** `/handbook` — public app handbook hub (no auth gate). Header **Handbook** stays here.
- **What the user sees:** Localized heading **Handbook** and intro chrome, one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark in the marketing header (wordmark `/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow) and a language switcher, intro with a link to the api handbook on GitHub (`21gifts/api`), nav links to **Screens**, **Functions**, and **Endpoints**, plus a short lead for each part. Does not dump those three markdown files. After tapping the link icon on the Handbook heading, that button shows the check icon and `data-copied`.
- **Actions:** Change language, open a part, copy the hub heading URL, follow the api handbook link.
- **Calls:** `HandbookPage`, `HandbookIntro`, `HandbookCopyLink`, `LanguageSwitcher`.
- **Screenshots:** none. Documentation page, not a product screen.

## Screen: /handbook/screens

- **URL:** `/handbook/screens` — public screens handbook (no auth gate).
- **What the user sees:** Heading **Screens**, a three-level table of contents (chapter = first path segment, screen, variant), and nested compact cards (`HandbookFigure` via `HandbookImageViewer`) under global **Desktop** / **Mobile** and **Light** / **Dark** switches. Switches appear only when those baselines exist somewhere in the catalog. Each card has a ~220px preview, a written description of what the picture shows, a permalink label, and a copy-link. Clicking the preview opens the same PNG at full size in `HandbookLightbox` (close via X, backdrop, or Escape). The lightbox chevron shows the previous image (`handbook.previousImage`, “Previous screen”) and is not the page-back arrow. Topics that lack the selected combo are omitted. No topic picker. Marketing header has one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (`/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow).
- **Actions:** Jump via the contents nav, switch viewport/theme when available (applies to every card), open a preview at full size, step through every visible variant with Left/Right arrows or lightbox chevrons, copy a chapter/screen/card deep link, follow a hash deep link, return to the hub.
- **Calls:** `HandbookScreensPage`, `HandbookImageViewer`, `HandbookOutline`, `HandbookSectionHeading`, `HandbookFigure`, `HandbookLightbox`, `HandbookIntro`, `HandbookCopyLink`, `buildHandbookOutline`, `nextOutlineIndex`, `topicAnchor`, `parseScreenVariantDescriptions`, `screenVariantDescription`, `loadHandbookDocuments`.
- **Screenshots:** none. This page _shows_ product-screen goldens; it is not itself a golden.

## Screen: /handbook/functions

- **URL:** `/handbook/functions` — public functions handbook (no auth gate).
- **What the user sees:** Heading **Functions** and the functions markdown (`## Function: name`) only. No image switches. Marketing header has one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (`/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow).
- **Actions:** Read the markdown, return to the hub.
- **Calls:** `HandbookFunctionsPage`, `HandbookMarkdown`, `loadHandbookDocuments`.
- **Screenshots:** none.

## Screen: /handbook/endpoints

- **URL:** `/handbook/endpoints` — public endpoints handbook (no auth gate).
- **What the user sees:** Heading **Endpoints** and the endpoints markdown only. No image switches. Marketing header has one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (`/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated; the wordmark is not that arrow).
- **Actions:** Read the markdown, return to the hub.
- **Calls:** `HandbookEndpointsPage`, `HandbookMarkdown`, `loadHandbookDocuments`.
- **Screenshots:** none.

## Screen: /404

- **URL:** any unknown path (App Router `not-found.tsx`). There is no `page.tsx` for `/404`; Playwright uses `page.goto('/404')` which hits this screen.
- **What the user sees:** Marketing chrome with one top-left arrow (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none) beside the wordmark (`/` when unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated) and a language switcher, heading **404**, **This page does not exist.** There is no second back button.
- **Actions:** Change language, go home, or use header/footer links.
- **Calls:** `NotFound`, `MarketingHeader`, `MarketingFooter`, `LanguageSwitcher`.

### Variant: default

The only state.
